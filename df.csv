Barca,"I disagree. 

CL is the most prestigious competition - you only play the best teams in the continent.

La Liga is definitely the most grueling to win - the best team wins nearly every time, since it's a year round tournament.

Copa is a mini - CL - knockout competition with less glamour.

I say league + copa is about the same as CL - though in Madrid's case this year they have no shout of being called best team in the world - not even the best team in the country. So I think Barcelona and City, for example, can still be considered among the best teams in the continent",dyiik47

Our midfield is still massively overbooked, Rafinha could still come back, Arda on loan as well. ",dyienp7
Barca,"No man, I hope EV won't have that idea. Only way to go against Madrid is to be attacking as often as you can and to keep possession. They are good at creating goals out of a few chances, so it's best to give them none imho

Personally, this is also why I do think Liverpool has a realistic chance of beating Real ",dyieidt

Barca,"Tbf that was a simple finish. Great positioning and all but Messi/Neymar/Iniesta did all the work there.

Barca,"It seems my comment didn‚Äôt properly address what it intended to: I agree that he won‚Äôt work out here long term, but‚Äôs due to his touch not his distribution.

They are two distinct skills, one requires vision ball striking ability and confidence, the other requires technical control ability. He has the former (even fancies a free kick), lacks the latter, and at Barca the latter is the most important quality. 

I think we agree, I was just trying to make the distinction on exactly where his shortcoming is, because it felt like you were too broadly dismissive and when negative attributes on players are noted it‚Äôs best to avoid broad statements in order to focus the conversation. Otherwise different people interpret things differently and there is no productive conversation.

Barca,smh no Yerry Mina,dyhzgp9
Barca,"&gt; He was very comfortable on the ball and distribution in each match.

&gt; The area for concern was his first touch and ability to play with the ball close to his feet as he has a heavy touch which doesn‚Äôt do well in small spaces.

How can you say those two things simultaneously with a straight face? Ultimately 'playing with the ball' at Barca means that he will face a lot of high pressing so that is a skill he will need.

You just need to look at Pique and how massive a drop Yerry is from Pique's skill in this regard.

Also, it wasn't like his defensive performance was flawless. He made so many simple defensive mistakes during that game, including both goals and during that sequence of Sergi Roberto's red.

All I'm saying is that I do not think he will be a 3rd CB. He may be the 4th CB but he will not be the first choice centreback replacement (even if Vermaelen leaves). Mark my words.",dyhzet1
Barca,"Yerry Mina, Digne, Aleix Vidal, Andre Gomes out of the group.",dyhzelh
Barca,"The thing I‚Äôm excited for about next year is a non standard starting lineup, one that‚Äôs fluid on a weekly basis similar to how Madrid approaches things with all their personnel. ",dyhz7sm
Barca,"Few things:

Griez is Is a complimentary player as opposed to a star player. He makes players around him better, he plays his role in the team, and most importantly, he‚Äôs a reliable player. That will work well for Messi, better than a player like Alexis/Neymar who, while very talented, are not complimentary but star players who need he ball and freedom to use/lose it. I think we will see Griez and Messi do very well together as Griez seems to make the players around him better.

What I am really excited for, something we haven‚Äôt see in a long time, is a a non-standard XI. Look at Madrid coming into a big game: how will they line up? Who starts and who sits? Zidane has the luxury of choosing Bale or Isco or Benzema or none of them. Barca have not been in this situation for some time, our XI has been somewhat static in most seasons to where when a big game is coming you can write the starting XI well ahead of time. Having the similar luxury to start Coutinho, Dembele, Griez or none of them will bring in a lot of tactical flexibility to the team so that we are always approaching games fresh with a unique plan. Let‚Äôs look at last year: Sergi/Pique/Masche/Alba, Busi/Rakitic/Iniesta, MSN. Perhaps Masche and Umtiti are swapped, but that‚Äôs not a tactical difference. The point is that any opponent knew our shape, personnel and approach to any large game. Having an abundance of ‚Äúshould be starters‚Äù means that each games XI will be a bit more unpredictable and tactically surprising to our opponent. ",dyhz6fa

I think Paco will stay but we'll have to wait and see. In midfield Arthur replacing Gomes should give us more control.

He's either dribbling past people or looking for the killer pass or whatever comes up to his mind. And it takes him a second or two if he doesn't find that pass then he'll just made a normal one, which by the time he decides, the options have already been narrowed down and the options remaining are being pressured.

We can murder anyone with Messi as false 9 and Griezmann and Dembele on both sides, together with Coutinho, Busquets and Roberto in midfield. Sorry but Suarez and Rakitic should sit on the bench. It's time to be exciting again. It's time to be BARCA again.

People don't realize how good Roberto can be as a RCM, because he never plays there. Being either a RB or a RM in a 4-4-2 that we should never play anyway made people forget how good Roberto actually is in his natural position. Give him the starting spot as a RCM in our own 4-3-3 and just behold the awesomeness. We don't even need to go to the marker to search for another starting midfielder.

If anything one can safely use the rhetoric that Jurij did in his comment, because Barca have thoroughly dominated in the last few decades, so its quite convenient to have an idiot like him play it safe, because No one gives a crap about CWC GoH because its never been a thing. 

Marca and Madrid press and fans were already concerned this could happen once the fixtures were out and the early season form meant this could be possible. So its easily feasible CWC was a pre-setting to cover their bases. ",dyhkwui

Barca,"Not concerned, I'm expecting a 3-0 win.",dyhk50o
Barca,"How is it going to work on the pitch though? The top priority is obviously Messi so we should build the team to suit him. This season he's basically a 10 and we all know how well that has worked since he's exactly where he wants to play all the time. He also needs space in that area so it's crucial to have players providing width to stretch the opponent, meaning you need some wingers. Griezmann was a winger and Coutinho has played mostly on the left, but the both like to cut in so the width provided by either would be limited. That means we'll rely a lot on our fullbacks providing the width, but that's also a dangerous game since it might expose Pique and Umtiti too much, though I'm sure Valverde wouldn't compromise on that in reality.

I understand bringing in someone with experience who can play on the right since Dembele is still so raw, but I think what we'd benefit the most from is a more traditional winger. However, one benefit of Griezmann is that he has been molded by Simeone so he should play his part defensively too. Of course that didn't work out with Arda, but he also basically admitted that he doesn't want to work hard anymore before joining. Another upside is that we're basically building the French national team at this rate lol. In any case, I really hope it's a signing that Valverde has asked for. I'm certain he has a plan to incorporate him in a solid XI if that is the case, but I'm afraid that isn't the case and it's just the board buying a shiny toy to win over some socios.",dyhk2iy

Barca,"Valverde should be judged against Enrique, not Pep. Pep had a lot of young (and experienced) players at his disposals, and Tito Vilanova who I suspected at least was nearly half responsible of their era success.

What Enrique had, was better than Valverde. Neymar, younger Iniesta, Bartra, and Suarez (in his first &amp; a half season), Xavi for a season, and Alves. Yet he depended on Neymar &amp; Messi for playmaking, pushed Iniesta deeper, rotation was fucked up in his time. He benched Bartra a lot in favor of Matheu, relied on Rafinha &amp; Gomes too much (and didn't solve Gomes problem with self confidence until he left), didn't care about Alba, not much defensive strength/tactic (just turned midfield as another defensive line) and basically when trident didn't work or Suarez &amp; Neymar didn't performed much, we were screwed unless Messi pulled our ass out of trouble. So much emphasis on fast counter attack that I don't really remember any other kind of play we had beside that style of attack &amp; the rest of the team supporting MSN.  [This](https://streamable.com/9tb6k) is pretty much typical of what we had in terms of Enrique defence. One thing from Lucho I rate really high was fitness related, he got Suarez &amp; Pique back to prime fitness.

What I saw from Valverde wasn't perfect, basically conservative, putting emphasis on defensive strength &amp; conserving energy, yet used midfield in more balanced fashion than Enrique, trying to change according to what the team had in hand but showed willingness to adapt. Tried new things without being too careless as in his conservative nature, didn't always get tactic correctly about 25-30% of the entire season, but compared to the last season of Lucho, that's much better. Lucho (along with the bigger source of problems, Rosell/Barto) dealt us the biggest damage in the last 7 years by moving firmly away from Pep/Tito legacy, and Valverde had to picked up his mess &amp; yet still delivered a double. 

If a player can be forgiven for not performing &amp; adjusting in his first season, Valverde should be given as much chance &amp; privillege.",dyhja0d

Barca,I don't think that bringing Arthur in the winter break is comparable to the Coutinho situation. Arthur expected to be in our starting eleven and to make a great impact in important games straight away.

And a major downside of Coutinho coming in winter was that it meant that he cannot play CL for us. This is no issue with Arthur.,dyhh1c3

&gt; The plan for Barca this summer is to get rid of as many as eight players and then get a centre-back, a right-back, centre midfielder and potentially two forwards, depending on what happens. If they get Griezmann, you could argue they need another centre-forward if Paco Alcacer leaves.

I know Guillem has become notoriously unreliable but lets not forget the reason he even grew a reputation in the first place was that he *was* reliable. He started chatting lots of shit which damaged his reputation.

It still is a rumour and I wouldn't take it too seriously, however it did appear that Suarez was speaking on the Radio Station about Griezmann with certain authority according to the following article \(and also judging from the tone of his voice\) : [https://www.sport\-english.com/en/news/barca/luis\-suarez\-takes\-antoine\-griezmann\-signing\-as\-done\-6801124](https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/luis-suarez-takes-antoine-griezmann-signing-as-done-6801124):

&gt;In January SPORT revealed that Antoine Griezmann and FC Barcelona had a deal for the forward to join this summer. And now Luis Suarez has given away the fact Griezmann will join from Atletico Madrid on Radio Rincon, a station in Uruguay, as noted by Cadena SER in Spain.  
&gt;  
&gt;The forward said: ""It makes the club proud to bring players of this quality like Antoine, like Dembele and Coutinho came. He's a player who brings a huge amount, he has a lot of years playing at the highest level, always fighting. He rules up front for Atletico and that is fundamental.  
&gt;  
&gt;""He is not coming to take the place of anyone, but with the ambition of winning important things. He will be welcome.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Barcelona will have to pay Griezmann's 100 million euros release clause to sign him. Nothing is 100 per cent agreed but it seems like he will sign for 5 seasons and be one of the best paid players in the squad. He could form a new trident with Leo Messi and Luis Suarez.

Barca,"Yeah but undefeated liga and copa&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 3 CL‚Äôs in a row

I say this as a Madrid fan coming in peace and not trying to undermine Barca‚Äôs accomplishment. ",dyh8swf
Barca,correct,dyh6waf
Barca,"What's funny is the people down below saying EV wouldn't play like this because he risk averse, or that Busquets can't play along side Rakitic in this way. It's like they've only seen Barca play a couple times this season and are pretending to know what they're talking about. 

This is how we played against Depor literally last week and how we played against Girona in that 6-1.",dyh6tcq
Barca,Thank you!,dyh6ru6
Barca,They're gonna loan out a 100 million euro player? Lol,dyh60fe
Barca,This should be posted on the open thread,dyh5ukc
Barca,B√∫squets doesn‚Äôt play well with a partner in cdm if he‚Äôs not fit then we could play like this. But with him there this wouldn‚Äôt work,dyh5ahl
Barca,"Yeah OP, this is what our 442 is. It's just that you have Messi starting in midfield whereas he generally starts forward and drops back. ",dyh4l0j
Barca,Goodbye midfield,dyh4hru
Barca,We did have a purple 16/17,dyh4gye
Barca,We could trick those cunts into giving one. Make it look like they're doing it for Iniesta and just have all the players walk through. This feels like something Pique might do üòÇ,dyh49q1

Barca,"I think Neymar is a good guy and an amazing player, and I would take him back happily. Most of the drama surrounding him was the fault of his dad. ",dyh30hu
Barca,Too risky defensively Ernie won‚Äôt take any risks. He will probably go with either Iniesta or Paulinho to shore up the midfield. While playing coutinho from the RW.,dyh2ea9
Barca,Not true.,dyh1hn4
Barca,"This is how most of la masia players are , but Lucho got unwarranted hate for not using players from La Masia. These players are good enough for miidtable teams. And players like Sergi Roberto still get a chance.",dyh1hes

Barca,"Captaincy, chemistry, quality..",dyh0l10
Barca,need a hug?  ,dyh01z1
Barca,Everytime dembele played Messi will be having free space! When Dembele does not play Messi should play make from the centre! So with Coutinho and Dembele we can maximise our scoring opportunities by feeding the chances to Messi or Suarez! Later in the second half EV can play defensive once we have the lead,dygzek8
Barca,If only he realized before coming back we would still have Mboula and maybe Mbappe instead of Dembele.. but he had to try ha! ,dygz24p
Barca,"Not undermining that he has been great, but most of the vid is some horrible attempts to injure him... I realize it's good dribbles stopped after a foul but damn some of them look scary. With his injury issues, he is lucky that he has been fine since he started this loan spell. I hope he doesn't play injured though, which might have worse consequences down the road.

No word on whether or not he will be sold, he hasn't been saying anything in that regard afaik unlike Deulo, so there is some chance he might come back after all. As long as he can stay healthy, I would definitely give him the playtime.",dygywu5
Barca,"He's Neuer mate, once he's back I doubt it will take him too long to get back inform",dygyvfi
Barca,I want more Tom and Yerry ,dygypit
Barca,"I don't think he'll be a big rotational option, but he won't be playing 50\+ games. You and a lot of other people think he is going to hit the season running at full speed, playing amazing. What if he isn't performing? This is the sunk cost fallacy in place. Just because we spent 100m\+ we have to play him in hopes of him turning out ok when it might not be the case.

He'll need time to develop, this season was basically a wash. It could take him a whole other year for that to happen. Plus, unless Suarez is banging in goals again, he is the one that's going to be dropped. Griezmann and Dembele are the future for the next 5 years, and if Suarez isn't performing he will see the bench. ",dygy8ob
Barca,Wenger?,dygxqe3
Barca,For how long was he our manger?,dygxl5p
Barca,haven't we been playing busquest and rakitic in a double pivot in 442 anyway?,dygxfw3
Barca,How so,dygx7li
Barca,"I think Neuer is still capable of being a step above MaTS and if he can hit that form he is the starter, its up to the coach to see if he can. ",dygwu1u

Barca,I will love if u can tag me in future updates thanks,dygwo0t
Barca,"Ask him, that's what he told me",dygwev6
Barca,Eh i disagree. Pique was speaking generally imo. ,dygwc33
Barca,We pretty much played this all season. ,dygw8gy
Barca,"In the last 20 years? You have got to be fucking kidding me.

Cuenca at least had a lot of tactical awareness and knew his limitations, which made him valuable.

Also, I completely disagree with your statement regarding Deulo and La Masia. La Masia still is what it was. Sometimes it simply puts a certain type of (influential) player too much on a pedestal. But we've had enough talented players who could've easily had more value than bought players (for instance: Grimaldo &gt; Digne).

The idea that every player that comes through La Masia must be the new Xavi/Iniesta/Messi is bullshit. I want new useable players in order to splash a lot of money on great ones. I feel a lot of sympathy towards Digne, but I hate the fact that we've wasted millions on the likes of him or Song or many others. Sergi Roberto is what I want and what most of the culers said to be waste.",dygw7ti
Barca,"Ahh, what am I supposed to do on weekends after May 20?",dygvvfa
Barca,Piques comments were regarding that one game only... They outplayed us both times,dygvsva
Barca,"Because Messi, Saurez, Griezmann will not only be preferred over Dembele but will be regular starters and Dembele will end up being a rotational option, again. Which will further stall his development. ",dygvovj
Barca,Neuer?,dygvlvw
Barca, Ux,dygvlh8
Barca,2 Defensive mids pretty much ,dygvk23
Barca,I read some comments above. What is double pivot anyway?,dygvdbc
Barca,thats what we basically play now,dygvbdc
Barca,Putting Busquets in a double pivot is like having a Ferrarri and only driving it in the city,dygv7qh
Barca,"What if they lineup first, do our pasillo and as the barca players start coming out they start forming at the end of the pasillo one by one until Iniesta is the last one and then he gets a passion of both ",dyguz7y
Barca,I understand the captaincy argument but why would Neuer bench TS during the World Cup? He'll be completely out of form,dyguyjc
Barca,Our bench sucks. We can‚Äôt rest starters without dropping points. We went down 0-2 against Sevilla without Messi and Busquets. We conceded 2 against Depor without Iniesta last week. There‚Äôs a reason why our starting XI play so much. The drop off to the bench is too big. ,dyguxsy
Barca,"Double Pivot, no!!!!",dygup5d
Barca,"the ""no running"" thing is taken out of context especially now that the controversies started with him.


Going from that Atletico team to Barcelona it's obvious you're gonna run less just because of the way we play",dygtyra
Barca,"How is it a class move saying we don't show respect to all the Barca players who won the league title EXCEPT Iniesta. But even then we do the pasillo not because he won title but because what he means for the spanish people. So at no time do they want to show Barca respect for their achievement.

And why would they be doing a pasillo for Iniesta if he is part of the team that didn't do the pasillo for their CWC win? Isn't that their whole argument why they don't want to do it in the first place?

And why would Iniesta accept Real Madrid not respecting what his Barca collegues achieved this season in the league?

And why is it special if RM gives Iniesta a pasillo? So does RM now represent the whole Spain? Why is it special if Real does that but no one will tell Villarreal, Levante or La Real they should do the same pasillo for Iniesta. No, because they are trying to make RM still look classy even though they act like dogshit.

This is all bullshit coming from the RM Media.",dygtvcm
Barca,"I don't get the concern about how we're going to fit Messi, Suarez, Griezmann, and Dembele into our squad next season. Going into a 60 game season with only 3 quality forwards would be a disaster especially when two of them will be 31.",dygtumj

 RM doesn't deserve any chance of using Iniesta or any other Barca players to their advantages.

Period.",dygt4lb
Barca,"Not saying we had a better season, but we never got dominated by them like we did at the superxopa",dygsurl
Barca,"I mean, they could still make the Pasillo. After our players passed thru it, out team can line up accordingly to give a grand pasillo to Iniesta, who would come out last.",dygsc7p
Barca,35M is an okay fee for a player who had two major injuries and isn't happy with his squad status.,dygs9v1
Barca,"You are one of the best to play the game but not enough minutes on the pitch to gain confidence and do what you know you can do. It's a harsh-cutthroat sport, especially if you come out of La Masia as one of the legends. Good luck.",dygs6g9
Barca,"&gt; (...) Cuenca, the most frustrating attacking player I‚Äôve seen in a Barca shirt in the last 20 years

Cutting it close with Cuenca but check out the videos on Simao Sabrosa. I shit you not the guy triggered me instantly. 
",dygs0fp
Barca,"&gt; But, we all know that we work well under a leader who support, encourages and motivates. And we tend to be complacent while working under a captain who isn't as motivating, and as strict. The successors of Puyol were never motivating captain, they were either very silent or calm. Puyol wasn't. I am tending to attribute our non existent fighting spirit to the lack of a born leader. We became a very beatable team these days, than under Puyol.

There are many types of leaders. To imply Iniesta is less of a leader isn't doing anyone justice. I'm sure Messi for one respects Iniesta as much as any other captains. You failed to notice those captains play with different teammates. How many players in this season played for us for more than 3 years?

To expect us to go out and get after teams like years past was unrealistic. Yes, the Roma tie was disgraceful and extremely disappointing but just as much blame goes to the players as valverde. They simply didn't show up and thought the tie was won after the first leg. Yes, his tactics were wrong and playing not to lose was a bad decision but I believe he will learn from that.

Deulofeu is the prime example why La Masia just isn‚Äôt the world class players factory it used to be. People keep getting upset for the lack of minutes of La Masia when in reality they are just not good enough.

Barca,"&gt; Liverpool deploys pressing in their game so Coutinho should be comfortable regarding the pressing game. Dembele had months off injured but just because he is injure doesn't mean that he shouldn't be learning how to properly press.

I'm not saying they don't know how to press. I'm saying that just because they might know how to, doesn't mean the rest of the squad aren't already tired.

&gt; Oh my ..... That‚Äôs why 34 year-old De Rossi and 30 year-old Nainggolan destroyed us with their pressing, right?

The exception isn't the rule. You will not find them consistently press like that which is why they couldn't against Liverpool.

&gt; It has little to do with age, it has to do with positional organization, anticipation and teamwork.

I mean there's no point going on if you believe pressing is possible without lots of energy, something you can only get consistently from younger players.

Knowing how to press is the mental part, but actually closing players down and physically moving? That's stamina. It's not possible to press without stamina, therefore, the physical part is the most important.

Anyway no point going on.",dygd35b

Barca,"&gt; Where was the pressing against Roma? And it's not a one off.

Yes, actually over the course of the season, it was in the spectrum of 1 off.  

And you do know Eibar is ranked No 1 in pressing in Liga don't you? Of course they were going to be testing. The team overcame that.  
Which Sevilla are you talking about because anyone who follows them consistently should be aware of their schizophrenic ways.  
Sure in the 2-2 draw they tested Barca but Final is a bigger game and Barca showed their quality there.  

Whether one wants to use Statistics or the Eye-test, its clear. Barca are a top pressing side this season still.  
And as mentioned the last time Barca pressed late consistently into 2nd half in months of April was under Pep. That with a squad average age as mentioned.  

&gt; Iniesta at 33 played every week, Rakitic came back from US after friendlies and was played so that the Invincible streak continues. 

Are you forgetting the fact that Pulinho had played over 80 games without a break since Feb 2017 hence can't be the starter all the time.  
In fact of the time he plays he is only on the field [57% of the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/85lh4i/remaining_fixtures_and_minutes_played/).  

Busquets also got injured for 28 days from March-April and Rakitic had to fill in for him and for the first time since Busquets rose to senior team at Barca there is finally a player who can play his role without sucking there. That meant he was going to be relied upon out of necessity.  
Furthermore Rakitic was on form, he was our top player post Feb along with terStegen. Players don't like to sit out anyway when they are on such a high. 
Furthermore again, Rakitic is matching his season minutes he had in prior seasons for Barca barring of course last season where he was rotated more(like everyone else) and that turned out fantastic as we all know. 


&gt; Alba was totally gassed 

Firstly he doesn't look gassed to me at all. He is still bombing down the flank as ever and covering in defense when required. And Digne has stepped in at between just fine. Even Sergi had to play there for a while when Digne was also injured. We don't have another LB to rotate in.  

Critically, Alba has played about the same amount he did prior to previous season, ONE which like with Rakitic needs special mention because he had a mini-falling out with Lucho, Neymar issues, and those ridiculous over the top rotations, such great rotations.  

&gt; Roberto who isn't a RB by trade looks completely jaded due to lack of stamina.

How is this a point.  
Vidal failed as a RB prospect and thus leaving the team with a new comer still adjusting to Barca and basically being in his 2nd breakout season of his career.  
And Sergi was the better RB despite Semedo having individual skill advantages because Sergi understood the system and combined his skill sets properly and deployed them at the right moments.  

YET, the minutes sharing was about par, meaning Sergi has only played about 4 and a half matches worth of minutes more at RB than Semedo over the course of the entire season.  

The team had no choice but to do this. Furthermore by the end of the season in gross terms Sergi would have played about the same amount of minutes he did last season and that was a season where there was no Semedo to share the load.  ",dyg9s9p

Barca,"I'm a Gremio fan. He is very solid and commit very few mistakes. He is not a prolific goal scorer or assistant. His job is to provide consistency to the midfield and make the team work. He is very good with and without the ball. For Gremio, he is the guy that other players look for when in bad situation, because he is very technic and the ball sort of glues to his feet. He is very good at creating space and finding the best pass or dribble out of pressure. Most times he starts plays receiving balls from the CBs and guiding the movements in the midfield until the ball arrives to the attacking players. He then will stay close to the AMs and wingers in case the team needs to change the pace or the movement forward. His highlights obviously show only the brightest stuff from him. In many games he won't be noticed by all those flashy dribbles. He is a more discret, efficient guy.",dyg8jqo

Liverpool deploys pressing in their game so Coutinho should be comfortable regarding the pressing game. Dembele had months off injured but just because he is injure doesn't mean that he shouldn't be learning how to properly press. Pressing is more of a mental exercise knowing where you should be on the field and whom you would close down and what each players' job is. It's down to the manager to give these instructions. 

Again excuses... 

&gt;Pressing isn't about how good you are at football, it's about age. You don't need to be good at football to run a lot, you mostly need to be a young player.

Valverde had to play to the teams strengths, he made us very difficult to beat, he knew Messi is a genius and can play him wherever he wants and he will have a massive impact. He saw we had trouble with our midfield the season before he took over and saw a solution, an extra midfielder and giving Iniesta enough rest to recover.

It might not be beautiful football but it's not terrible, we have had great results and have been pragmatic when we have needed too, when Dembele and Coutinho came back in the team it improved the quality but we will see the best of Dembele next season.

Where was the pressing against Roma? And it's not a one off. We suffered against Eibar, Sevilla, Atletico and many other side's

Only two players not rotated enough. Iniesta at 33 played every week, Rakitic came back from US after friendlies and was played so that the Invincible streak continues. Everyone saw he was suffering. Alba was totally gassed. Messi had a minor issue due to which he couldn't play against Argentina but to save the unbeaten streak he comes on. Roberto who isn't a RB by trade looks completely jaded due to lack of stamina.

",dyg256y
Barca,"I think he was good enough, but just couldn't take direction. He only does what he wants to do. It's a shame because he was fun to watch. His speed and acceleration is nuts. ",dyg1y9r
Barca,"They have been rotating alot during the CL weeks, but this is a clasico. Even if it has no bearing on anything there's still prestige in it. Perhaps Zidane will play Cr7 etc anyway.


As for the game, I see this as the biggest hurdle to our undefeated season. If we can get a win or a draw here (which is highly uncertain given our rollercoaster form recently) then I'll finally entertain the possibility of an unbeaten season. But expect Madrid to do all they can to spoil that.


I just hope we don't come out with that passive approach which always gets us in trouble.",dyg1wv0
Barca,It certainly is better than Leganes first team. We could have rotated there,dyg1td4
Barca,"How is Tronsmart charger's quality? I found they also sell Bluetooth speakers, I would like to have a try because of Luis Suarez. ",dyg1khv
Barca,"Supposedly he‚Äôs already a star for Santos. At 17, he is the youngest player to play for Santos in the Cop Libertadores. 5 goals in 21 appearances, which is supposedly faster than than what Neymar did? I was reading somewhere that he‚Äôs more established than Vinicius Jr.",dyg1jxl
Barca,"Our bench is not nearly good enough to rotate with our starting XI without dropping loads of points. No busquets and Messi against Sevilla, go down 0-2. No iniesta against Depor, concede 2 etc. ",dyg1jrm
Barca,"Watch any of the big games we played this season. Sevilla CDR, first Valencia game, Clasico, etc. 


We play attacking football only when it matters as to not to tire our squad out. ",dyg15hc
Barca,What world cup group matches are you all excited for? ,dyg11pl
Barca,"The thing people need to realize though, is that using Pep as a benchmark for ""attacking play"" is ridiculous and will only mean that people will never be satisfied. Some of the football the team played during Pep was so good that it was borderline impossible to improve upon.

We're already playing attacking football - we've scored around 90 goals in the league so far (the most of any team this year) and will likely end up at around 100 goals total when the league is done, which on average is just 10 goals less in a entire season compared to the least 7+ years.

I agree that we in some games this season could be playing more attacking football (we all know which games), but again, it's Valverde's first season and he's never managed a team as big as this, so naturally he's not gonna take too many risks in his first season. We also gotta take into consideration that he's got quite different players than we had when Pep was here. No midfielders even close to the trinity of Xavi/Busi/Iniesta in their prime.

I just personally hope we'll start playing more fluid/fluent football next season, with more effective pressing and being better in posession (essentially defending with the ball instead of without it).",dyg0s74
Barca,"He doesn't want to rotate, he wants to be the starter.",dyg0s1q
Barca,"Yes these are great prices considering that the club has been doing that whole ""VIP ticket"" bullshit for months leading up to this game. They wanted 1100 euros for the cheapest ticket. And the likes of viagogo had 450 as the cheapest ticket for months.


I myself managed to find two soci seats for 350 each just yesterday. I didn't dare to wait since it's so hard to know if this game will be full or not given the circumstances.


I checked the club website earlier today and now you can get a seat for around 170.",dyg0h18
Barca,Messi is not the entire team though. Our midfield has been an issue since Xavi left us and it will become even more of an issue now that Iniesta is leaving. ,dyfzyv9
Barca,"We ARE pressing. There is no 1 way to press, there are multiple modes of doing so. Do you think Barca, City, Napoli, Bayern and Liverpool all press the same exact way?  

We were in April and the team was pressing in the opposition half in the 79-80th minute. The last time this happened was under Pep. 

AND our primary starting 11 average age is 29.5, which at this level of grandpa age.  

Our press is positional block, its designated to covering the lanes and conserving energy due to the factors listed above, rather than what teams like City, Napoli do who press with intensity and are very directional from an individual point of view.  

And combined with the fact that our defense due to the shape we played in defensive phase it meant that we can deploy such a type of Press without be utterly shot come later months like we have been for 5 freaking years since Pep on this front.  

Furthermore, only 2 players were overplayed or not rotated enough. Pique and Suarez(Messi doesn't count for any coach so far in his career, he is a normalized entity).  
   
Everyone else got rotated as much was possible with the squad. A squad which was basically the same from last season due to Dembele's injury, Neymar gone so worse in attack. Suarez on horrible form, even worse. Iniesta not cutting it, Coutinho coming in January (by which point the EV led team had already done the business).  
A squad which last season saw rotations for supposedly lowly matches with 5-6 players changes with not well known outcomes, i.e. Losing the league.  ",dyfzycr
Barca,YES.,dyfzwku
Barca,Totally agree,dyfzwbm
Barca,"&gt; No it doesn't Then where was it when Cout and Dembele were fit?

The rest of the squad had already played 5 months of football.

&gt; Other teams are pressing well with inferior players than ours like Napoli and Betis and they are doing well.

Pressing isn't about how good you are at football, it's about age. You don't need to be good at football to run a lot, you mostly need to be a young player.",dyfzhej
Barca,"No it doesn't 
Then where was it when Cout and Dembele were fit? Or are you going to make another excuse of them not having enough time ? Other teams are pressing well with inferior players than ours like Napoli and Betis and they are doing well. 

Well Valverde is going to have Dembele and Cout for the summer (after WC) let's see what he does. I doubt he'd improve it by much. ",dyfzbmf
Barca,Doubt it. I believe he and Deulofeu have publicly expressed their feelings that they don‚Äôt want to play for Bar√ßa ,dyfz858
Barca,"Considering Dembele was out for 5 months and Couts came in Jan, I think it does.",dyfyrn7
Barca,"Yeah when you contrast him with Dembele the difference really is night and day. The dude would cross into a wingback 95% of the time, whereas whenever Dembele crosses he plants it right at someone's feet or head.

Obviously Deu had other things stronger than Dembele, like workrate, released the ball quicker, less failed dribbles (and successful ones of course), but man, when you just think about Deu cross vs Dembele cross...",dyfyll5
Barca,"Preseason doesn't tell the whole story, but who knows in then next season we might play attacking football.",dyfyg9w
Barca,"Based on what? Very narrow margin you put in there, so would like to know what you base it on?",dyfydbr
Barca,"When I search google I find he's 1.78m and 5'10"". However, 1.78m is 5'8"".",dyfya9h
Barca,So fucking stupid. Why would they give the players so much leverage? There is also a chance they just leave. Our club is so poorly managed.,dyfy6xn
Barca,"Our pressing stats under Lucho were the highest in LaLiga and Europe with Messi and Suarez. Just because Neymar left doesn't excuse this significant decrease especially when we paid 250m + for his replacements. 

",dyfy3dh
Barca,"Ah, right on. I read it and forgot lol",dyfy31c
Barca,"&gt; I was really looking forward to see our team press up the field again just like his Bilbao side did. And don't say he doesnt have a good side. He has the GOAT by his side.

You don't need a good side to press, you need a young side. We don't have that.

It's also strange you say we should be able to press because he has Messi but we should all know by now that Messi doesn't press for the vast majority of the time.",dyfxtls
Barca,"If I am wrong then I admit I am wrong, I don't see a problem with it.",dyfxr7h
Barca," Since we're comparing him to Rijkaard, remember his first year here, we were in a transition like noone other since then, yet we managed to play the best football in Spain by the end of the season at a certain level that I believe if we were in the CL we could've had a big surprise, that of course, after a pretty disastrous start, losing El Clasico after half a century on Camp Nou after 1-5 in Malaga and being much behind Madrid and eventually we managed to finish above them, with chances to snatch the title after winning on Bernabeu but failed in Vigo and Zaragoza, we would've won the title by 1 point if after beating Real we would've won the last 3 games which I was hoping heavily in that May.
 The transition continued when we changed Kluivert and Saviola with Eto'o and Larsson; Cocu leaving and Luis Enrique, Overmars retiring, Quaresma clearly failing but we signed Deco, Giuly and fullbacks Belleti and Sylvinho and signed Gio after the loan.
 Damn, that was a transition, this isn't anything close to that. Dream came true in Paris, what days those were, couldn't sleep after we beat Chelsea in that swimming pool that night.
 I also managed to fly to Barcelona that summer and see the Gamper with Bayern, running from airport to the hotel and to the Camp Nou in a matter of minutes.",dyfxjrv
Barca,"Yes, but even with rotation our squad is too old to press like other teams do. Lucho rotated last season and the squad still crashed at the later stages of the season.",dyfxbyd
Barca,"Anyone know about that rodrigo kid? Supposedly his agent was here, 50m RC, how good is he for a striker ",dyfx93i
Barca,That's the fucking point Val should have rotated,dyfx7rb
Barca,This lad deserves more time on the pitch. It'll be better for his career.,dyfx4tt
Barca,"We pressed at the start of the season because it was the start of the season and our players weren't as tired. We didn't decide to stop pressing, we just couldn't.

Sure we could've rotated better but our starting XI easily has the oldest core in Europe compared to other top sides, we're simply not capable of pressing all season long like other opponents do, even with rotation. We need new young players in the starting XI, Couts, Dembele and hopefully Griezz will all help with this.
",dyfx37y
Barca,we don't have attacker that press. Messi coutnihno Saurez and Dembele are not renown fro their pressing,dyfwzvt

Visca El Barcaa",dyfwndv
Barca," I'm sorry for him, I guess he didn't turn out as good as everybody expected, despite his great talent.
 I still think he can play in a top 4 European League at a team that fights for a UCL position constantly.
 It was nearly impossible to get into our front line around 2011 when he was hopping from Barca B to the first team, we were lining up Messi, Villa, Pedro/Alexis and they were breaking records in goal scoring then.",dyfwjq5

Barca,LOL those are words not often spoken online. ,dyfwfx4
Barca,"I mean if theres var do we need goalline tech? If the ball crosses the line they can see it on video and you tell the main ref it's a goal, no?",dyfwcz3
Barca,"I wrote a long comment about it this too. 

It feels like 95% of the transfer conversations don‚Äôt really grasp the impact wages have on these things, when it‚Äôs probably the most important factor. ",dyfwck9
Barca,"Ha, as if Barca wants him back anyways.",dyfw59v
Barca,"Nope, that‚Äôs an overly simplistic and speculative view. 

The real answer is wages.

A player like Arda (Song was the same way) would make most mid table or bottom table sides better, so why aren‚Äôt they jumping at the chance to buy or Loan him?!? It‚Äôs because they agree to a contract with Barca at a heightened wage rate and then when they fail to work out they are still entitled to that wage. 

So let‚Äôs say Arda signs here and we pay 40 for the signature and then his salary jumps from 3mm to 9mm per year (illustrative numbers). A mid table side would be offered the benefit of a 40mm player for free (on a loan) but that also means they have to pay him 9mm when perhaps his real value is 3-4mm. So even though they are acquiring a talented player‚Äôs services for seemingly free, they have to pay a wage above market for why they are getting.

This is what makes these players difficult to sell too, because a buyout price restructures that contract, so maybe a team only wants to buy Arda for $20 but that‚Äôs not enough to buyout his contract so it won‚Äôt work; the amount to buy out he contract is say $40 (because of the wages) and no one wants to pay that so they stay on the squad and we try to find a loan counter party, which is difficult because of the above. 

To put it in practical terms: you sign a 5 year lease on a nice apartment for $2000 per month. Then there is a recession and all of a sudden nicer apartments are going for $1000 per month, but you are locked I. For 5 years at $2000. Obviously it‚Äôs going to be hard to get someone to buy you out of that lease. Maybe for a year you are able to sublease it to your Turkish friend because the apartment has some special meaning to him (I.e. a reference to Arda in his home country), but after a year he realizes too that $2000 is too much and doesn‚Äôt want to buy you out of that lease either so you are still stuck with it.

I know this was long, but any topic of ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt we sell XYZ‚Äù always ignores this wage structure point which is probably the most germane to the topic. ",dyfw554
Barca,Hope he gets better. Not good enough for Barca atm.,dyfw1mb
Barca,Anyone else looking for that May calendar? Been busy with work and just want to make sure I haven't missed it,dyfw0t4

Is he doing it on consistent bases ? No 

Are we pressing ? Rarely, he'd rather sit back and defend 

Are we using La Masia and our youth players properly?
No 

I acknowledge that he can play beautiful football and he showed it but not on the level required at Barca. Next season he needs to focus on dumping the stupid 442 and have us play some attacking football consistently. ",dyfvnjc

Barca,How the hell did we let all those contracts get this close to expiry?,dyftgtj
Barca,VAR yes. No goal line technology. I expect dropped points.,dyftam6
Barca,How do you integrate players with the team? I guess by playing them more. The bench has performed a bit better compared to last season. Paco has been really good so has been Vermaelen. Denis has provided a spark from the bench. It's not like we didn't press at the start of the season. We did but for some unknown reason Valverde decided not to,dyft80j
Barca,This season we‚Äôre in transition. But next season really is a huge test for Valverde. We get the results. Will he start playing attractive football more often next season or will he continue to be conservative? Can‚Äôt wait ,dyft7st

i feel youre trading them just to stop Madrid from winning.",dyft7g3

with younger players hopefully coming in and Coutinho and Dembele fully integrated we will see more pressing.  ",dyft1ne
Barca,Can anyone confirm if we get goal line tech next season? We always lose points for disallowed goals ,dyft0f4

He had his chance and showed a glimpse of hope after Neymar's departure but having Dembele on the wings, you really are outclassed. ",dyfryxr
Barca,"I don't see why he wouldn't since he's a Masia guy. But I think Inter will buy him, his release clause is only ‚Ç¨35 million which is a steal. Odriozola is that good and he's young. He wouldn't have to play right away, he could get 10-15 appearances next year and then look to replace Jordi Alba in the future.",dyfrsva
Barca,"I‚Äôm too young to remember iniesta coming through the academy, but I started supporting Barca just as Messi was breaking into the first team in 2004. Bojan was the next best player I had seen since Messi, was so gutted to see him never make the cut. 

I have to say though that busquets coming into the first team was by far the biggest instant impact I‚Äôve ever seen from a la masia graduate though, even quicker than Messi. As soon as he started he looked like he was one of the most experienced players in the team. Wise head on young shoulders. ",dyfrpe2
Barca,In el classico there's no way. Everyone goes that game.,dyfrob4
Barca,"Ale√±a, Munir, Cucu/Miranda, Oriol, Puig, Cuenca, Collado, Ruiz, Perez are the La Masia products worth looking at. Only Munir and Ale√±a are good enough to be called up. In the meantime we need to strenghen the squad. Selling Gomes, Vidal, Paco, Rafinha and Deulo can give us enough money to make 2 mega signings in the summer.",dyfrktf
Barca,no doubt.,dyfrk5k
Barca,Yeah I've heard about that but I'm from Valencia and I think that's a big risk to go to Barcelona in the hope that someone gives you ticket. Specially considering that if I went it would be to see el cl√°sico and I can't imagine many people giving the ticket that day what do you think? ,dyfrj14
Barca,Agreed! The prices are very high regardless but its the safer route!,dyfrgxe

You do understand that Madrid will make atleast one, maybe two gal√°ctico like signings to their squad next season, right?",dyfrc0i

Barca,"Younger players like, Gomes Rafinha and Deulo are ready for it though.",dyfr34x
Barca,"It really can't be said enough but Cruyff was such a genius, he saw things that others don't, it's what made him such a great player and coach and it's the reason we continue to live off what he put in place.

Cruyff was one of the defenders of Pep when we had bad results in both his opening matches, he wrote about how even though the results weren't good, Pep had changed the team and we were playing well, how right he was.

I really love Valverde, I feel like apart from one result he really has been almost faultless this season, the one thing I love about him which I haven't seen since Pep was coach is that he seems to make the right changes, things you don't see and can't understand but he changes it and it gets results.

I remember when Pep was coach, he would make a change, a substitution, start a strange line up and you would be thinking, what is he doing? but 99% of the time he was right.

Pep really is a student of Cruyff and you can see that in how City play and how we and Bayern did when he was there.",dyfr296
Barca,"This was Iniesta last season and he didnt play soo much minutes because of fatigue and Cou played much more on his natural position LW.

So Rafinha would have had soo many minutes to play.(If real can manage to rotate,so can we)",dyfqyxl
Barca,"I know that they won the first few. Like I said that still doesn't mean much. They didn't do particularly well in the Galaticos times and only now started dominating when they have put together a good team. We dominated when we also had a good team during Guardiola's time. 

Yeah this season's strange. I still think the board and the manager aren't on the same page regarding players we need and that's not a good sign. ",dyfqxrr
Barca,"Don't forget the wages. Unfortunately most Barca players earn high wages that other teams can't afford, so they're not willing to pony up the money for the transfer.",dyfqstu

Do you think Rafinha will be interested to comeback?",dyfqp09

Barca,Good.,dyfqbm1
Barca,"- Would you consider this season to be a success? 
Yes, we won a double and haven't lost. Has our style of play been barca-like all season, no but regardless results on the field are what matters.
- If seniority wasn't an attribute, who would have you chosen as the captain of our squad?
I would go with Ter Stegen or Messi. Honestly I agree that he isn't a vocal leader but he's Barcelona through and through and when he needs to be vocal he's shown the ability to do so. Pique and Busquets just don't do it for me.

- Who we needs to sell?
I would sell Deulofeu, make the Turan and Douglas moves permanent, sell Denis Suarez and sell Gomes.

- Who to buy?
I would recall Rafinha, he's better than most of our depth central mids right now, recall Munir and give him a go. I would bring in Arthur, Griezmann, Odriozola, Sarr from Nice or de Ligt from Ajax (or both). We need some help on defense and adding Arthur would give us a good pivot central mid.

Your possible lineup for the next season?

                    ter Stegen
Semedo      Umtiti      Pique      Alba
          Busquets          Coutinho
                    Griezmann
Messi              Suarez        Dembele

Bench: Cillessen, Roberto, Sarr, Rafinha, Paulinho, Rakitic, Munir
Reserves: Digne, de Ligt, Vermaelen, Odriozola, Mina, Vidal, Arthur, Alcacer

Even worse, I checked the ratings on trustpilot for ticketbis, viagogo and stubhub. Ticketbis and it's partner site (one of the other two, don't recall) had a 1 out of 10 rating from a few thousand reviews each, and the third had a 3.5 out of 10 rating.

Barca,"Question TV3 :
Valverde is now coaching a small team. But I know you like a lot what he's doing. Do you see him becoming FC Barcelona coach in the near future? Is he ready for the challenge? 

Answer Johan Cruyff :
To understand what he's achieving, we have to see things in their context. 

The work he's doing so far is more than excellent. Not only the results, also the way they play.

If you watch Espanyol, you'll enjoy the way they play. And that wasn't happening before, even when they used to have better results. He is doing very good with what he has.

And I'm very happy that coaches like Valverde, Laudrup, Rijkaard, who try not only to obtain results, but also to implement a way of playing that people enjoy watching.

Barca,"Injuries or not, I can't really see Dembele fitting in under a manager who's having the same approach like Mourinho. Unlike any of these guys, someone like Tuchel knew how to use Dembele proberly. He had more freedom on the pitch and he had the right to be creative, that's why he became their best player.

And that's because, like I said before, a system where Dembele isn't afraid to showcast his abilties while being risky. Being allowed to be a dangerous player he is and can be. 

For that you need a certain system and a manager with vision. Zinedine Zidane is proving to be one with Real Madrid. Pep... just look at the improvement of Sane and Sterling. Heynckes is great with that too. 

Valverde just isn't that.

You put young attacking talents like Hazard with the likes of Mourinho &amp; Conte and years later you'll start asking what went wrong? A player with immense potential, but never gotten someone to develop him and hone his skills.

That case would repeat itself with Dembele. Neither Dembele or Valverde can afford sitting on the bench or developing him because of his preference for experience and rigid tactics. 

It's a much better idea to sign an established player who suits Valverde

Valverde can maximize the potential of hard working midfielders like Rakitic or a defender just like Conte did with David Luiz or Mourinho with various players throughout his career. It just won't work with a young winger or a young attacking midfielder IMO.",dyfkl37

Barca,"I see this competition argument thrown around a lot but I think it's a backwards description. Competition is a potential solution to the problem of stagnation due to a lack of change or variability in a player's life.  

It's the idea of losing the passion or drive to continue to perform due to monotony‚Äîlike if you just get to a new job and are really hyped but slowly taper off as weeks go by. Competition for your role will make you work harder, possibly perform better, but is also just a very aggressive, more-stick-than-carrot way of trying to fix this problem (and therefore may even have negative effects depending on the player).

There are better ways to address declining motivation and will, but they're much less straightforward and it's not something which is observable from the outside. 

However, although Rakitic is clearly not as bombastically good as he was in the 2014/15 season, I think only a minority of that is due to psychological stagnation-related decline. I think the club atmosphere and a system which has made it difficult for our midfield to do well, and once those are fixed, we'd see a much more effective Rakitic.",dmpk2bc

It's not just their previous failures, I think it is partly Messi. They see him play incredibly every game and try and drag the team out of the much and they dash his hopes every time. The anxiety and disappointment they must feel...

I think it says something that when Messi said he was going to retire from international football, the entire older generation were willing to follow him into retirement. They probably feel tortured before, during, and after every game they don't win. 

Unfortunately, stuff like this doesn't help, and if anything this kind of coverage probably makes it harder for them to freshen their perspectives and be able to play up to their level.",dmpjaxt

Most of the quote should be attributed to Menotti.

Also, the part of 18 goals against Venezuela is such ridiculous outlandish criticism - that was 40 years ago! Venezuela is a much, much better team now (we would have had a shot in qualifying if our country wasn't collapsing and our players had to go as far as to threaten to resign / resign from the team to get a new coach)

Google Translate (sort of bad, but you get the idea):

&gt;One of the great idols in the history of Colombian football, former player Faustino Asprilla said the word when speaking about the Argentina team, who, after a 1-1 draw with Venezuela at home, lives a drama in qualifying to qualify To the world cup. There have been criticisms for coach Jorge Sampaoli and for Lionel Messi's team-mates in the national team.

&gt;""How do they put him to play with various donkeys? Poor Messi, put him to play with the scum, players who are sold by the press as good. Let them play real players! ""He said in an interview with Espn.

&gt;""I do not understand the team, I do not know how they play,"" he added.

&gt;Cesar Luis Menotti, former coach of Argentina, also released the word against Sampa.

&gt;""Driving Argentina is not the same as running Sevilla, especially when you have Messi,"" he said.

&gt;Mena gave tips on how to play a tight team.

&gt;""Football is like a tango, you can not be running all the time. Need, pause, acceleration, pace, exchanges ... Argentina played so dizzily and this is the worst enemy of a player, ""he said.

&gt;And, finally, he was astonished at the performance of Argentina against Venezuela.

&gt;""The truth is that seeing all this was a shock. I played two games against Venezuela. We won by 7 to 0 in Caracas and by 11 to 0 in Rosario. There were 18 goals in two games and now I have to see those who can not win from Venezuela.",dmpeqe1

Barca,"[My more in depth analysis on the competition within the squad.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/6vqoku/the_problems_at_barca_run_deeper_than_just/)
It's not about what the players do on the pitch, it's about their mental attitude. If they have grown complacent because they know their spot is always secure then they come into the game as a weaker player. You're not constantly fighting to stay on top within your club because there's no one else to fight with.

If you play for a football club in real life you also experience this, fighting to stay on top of your position. 

&gt; Rakitic did lose his starting spot for a few important games including the one against PSG.

This is the only important game he lost his starting spot too Gomes in the CL. The other 8 were all his. Mind showing me games where he didn't start which were important in the CL and Liga?

At the worst times of last year, during his worst games, he looked overwhelmed more than not concerned (in comparison to Arda for instance) and I remember him looking like he was giving his all but was failing at doing what he wanted. He doesn't strike me as a player who would stop trying because he has not competition.

The argument from ReneMS is also a relevant answer, Rakitic did lose his starting spot for a few important games including the one against PSG. Some could argue that he was rested but I remember some seemingly voluntary exclusion from the starting eleven in important games.

None of our midfielders looked good last year, not even Busquets in his more defense oriented role. I don't understand why only Rakitic gets all the critics for a situation that looks to be for a good part due to our global team setup. We'll see what changes this season anyway...",dmpc6rb

Barca,"Tino is harsh but maybe fair here. I still back Sampaoli to turn Argentina around if he is given time. Whether they fail to qualify for the WC or not he should be given opportunity to do the job. If they don't make it though I expect his head will roll. 

Sidenote: Tino Asprilla was one of my favourite players of all time. Such a gifted player but a classic headcase. He got in trouble one time for firing his guns into the air during a party, maybe a NYE or some such. 

Check this story below for an example:

Told by Peter Beardsley (ex Newcastle team-mate of Asprilla):

&gt; ‚ÄúWe had an incident when we were playing Blackburn at home in the FA Cup. Kevin used to speak to Tino in Spanish and we were 1-0 down at half-time,‚Äù he recalled.

&gt; ‚ÄúKevin has come in and he‚Äôs fuming. He lost it but it‚Äôs in Spanish ‚Äì so we haven‚Äôt got a clue what he‚Äôs saying. He‚Äôs hammering Tino and all of a sudden he starts taking his kit off and we‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs strange‚Äô. He now walks between Kevin Keegan and Terry (McDermott) with no kit on bar a towel and starts running a bath.

&gt; ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs looking at us and trying to talk to us. He‚Äôs fuming ‚Äì but all we could hear was Tino running a bath, singing, whistling. And as a player we‚Äôre wetting ourselves thinking it‚Äôs funny but Kevin‚Äôs trying to keep a straight face, trying to tell us what to do.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe ended up winning the game and Rob Lee says me to ‚ÄòTell him well done on taking Tino off at half-time but why?‚Äô So I asked him what happened and he said: ‚ÄòI told him he had two minutes to get his finger out or he‚Äôs off.‚Äô Tino replied: ‚ÄòF**k you, I‚Äôm coming off now‚Äô.

&gt; ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how he was. He was mad ‚Äì but nice mad. He was different with the ball ‚Äì a skill that no one else has.‚Äù

Edit: btw, I doubt dembele will even get played on the left at Barca. It'll be delu or Denis and maybe suarez if valverde wants to try. I imagine dembele will be on the right and Messi more central. ",dmp79bc

LFP/RFEF has a rule that one not spanish club can play in the spanish league.
That place is used by Andorra in the fourth division. It would simply take a change of rule to allow Bar√ßa and the other catalan clubs to remain in La Liga.
Tebas said they would not allow the catalan clubs to remain, which is a clear lie.
Football is among the most important things for catalans and Tebas trys to get people vote No, because of that.
Loosing Bar√ßa (El Cl√°sicos), Espanyol and Girona would be just as big a loss for La Liga than loosing Catalunya for Spain is.
That would be financially the ruin for them, as the main thing La Liga has is the 2 best clubs in the world and a interesting competition among these clubs. Thats what Ligue 1, Bundesliga and Serie A are missing.
So if the RFEF and LFP are not stupid they would give everything that Bar√ßa remains or they can resign instantly.

Else there would be the possibility that Ligue 1 would gladly take us with open arms, to get the new Cl√°sico between PSG and Bar√ßa. Manuel Valls (ex primeminister France) even said that Bar√ßa would be welcome in Ligue 1.

But that is only the unlikely alternative as La Liga would never not retake Bar√ßa. They didn't even accept Neymars clause because of the third best player in the world leaving La Liga. They would never let the best/second best club in the world leave La Liga.

The only thing that might change is taxes from the salaries and political/economical stuff like that, but not La Liga related stuff.

Barca,"Bojan Krkic father returns to work for Bar√ßa and rejoins the technical secretariat of the club azulgrana. His return is one of the first consequences after the appointment of Pep Segura as the head of the football field.

The father of the player of Alav√©s was already linked for many seasons to the discipline azulgrana and was a basic piece for the technical secretariat of the Bar√ßa during several campaigns. He became one of Txiki Begiristain's trusted people and his reports were instrumental in incorporating or discarding certain players.

In June 2011, after the first year of Sandro Rosell's term, Bar√ßa announced that Bojan Krkic had stopped working with the club and did not renew the contract that expired on June 30 of that same year. His departure from Barca coincided with that of his son, who that same summer left the Camp Nou to test fortune in the Rome, directed by Luis Enrique.

When he left the club, Bojan Krkic was in charge of monitoring French football especially, while now in this new stage his main attack will be to control the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Balkans, which he dominates to perfection given that it is Serbian origin.

In these years away from FC Barcelona, Bojan Sr. has worked as a scout for Manchester City, hired by Txiki Begiristain, and has also collaborated with the 'Qu√® t'hi Jugues' program of Cadena SER, in which he had a section weekly. In it, he has occasionally revealed some signings that Barca did not make at the time, such as Luka Modric or the Belgian goalkeeper Courtois: ""I wanted to come, cost 3 million euros because he was an unknown goalkeeper. He was soon signed by Chelsea. My report should have been kept in some drawer of Zubi."" He also recommended Varane when he was a stranger, among others.

2. The role you are describing for Messi is a False 9 ST, not a CAM, as such he's going to further play into point #1.
3. Look at the [Passing map in the Betis game] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/6v24t3/passing_map_from_the_betis_game/?st=j7a12vy0&amp;sh=da02e339) and you'll see the average position of Dulo and Messi are very central. With Paco at LW he virtually disappeared but looking at Deulo, it's our system not because Messi can't play RW or whatever you're suggesting.
4. In response to 3 - I do, and it's pretty clear that what you're saying just doesn't ring true. If you actually look at what is happening then all your theoretical arguments are proven wrong - especially when you consider the alternative which just doesn't work as a midfield is more important than a winger - hence the fact that some teams can play without wingers but no team can play without a midfield. If you want us to just bypass the mids then go ahead adopt your system but that's the only thing that you will do and I guarantee while it might work against lesser opposition we will be found out against any decent team.

On Rafinha, however, I totally agree with you. The only way they take the ball from him is by fouling him. I was glad he didn't leave, and hopefully he stays injury free.

2. No, it's not because the front 3 swaps around much. He's very rarely seen on the right flank, and the average position of the LW/LF is always decidedly left of centre. And no, I don't want Messi to be a ""False 9 ST"" (whatever the hell that is).

3. I don't think you understand the concept of balance of formation, or positional play. It's paramount that there's an attacking player on the right side if you want to stretch the opponent.

Pointless arguing with someone who doesn't even understand the nature of the role of a CAM or RW though... I sincerely recommend studying football a bit more before posting a comment as confused as your above one is.",dmo4998

Barca,"1. If the wide AMs tucking in leads to more people in a 4-2-3-1, then there are objectively more in a 4-3-3 as the DM is more within the midfield than the can who can often be somewhat like a 2nd St. Even if they play more as a mid and less like a ST they're going to be less involved in the transition (which is our biggest problem area) so their role within the mids doesn't solve any issues we have. Further, if you're going to play messi as the CAM then he has very little defensive ability and as such is going to play more in the first, striker like role that I mentioned above.
2. The reason his average position is so close to the centre is because our front 3 swap around as much. Yes he drifts - he always has - but that is a strength rather than a weakness as has always been a part of out attack and makes it very hard for defenses to deal with as the pressure areas are constantly shifting. His role, and the way he plays is exactly what an inside forward does and his ""space"" is then occupied by a mid or by the rb. If he plays as the CAM he drifts everywhere, except the place where the team need that player to be the most - in the midfeild transitioning and building up to the attack rather than dropping away from it. The position you want Messi to be playing from your logic is as a False 9 ST, which means going to 2 up top, putting suarez on the wing or dropping him.
3. Now we have an actual rb and roberto will most likely be playing rcm a lot of that hole is actually filled. Attack is not null becuase you dont need to press at all points on the defence at once - thats inneffective - thats why we vary our attack and our pressure points and why that has worked for us in the past and will work for us once the team gels. Re. counters, thats nonsence - we're vulnerable due to a lack of defensive players which happens more in a 4-2-3-1 than in a 4-3-3 as we are able to essentially vary to a 3-atb in attack with a 4-3-3 with busi playing a halfback/anchor.",dmo309j

Barca,"1) It hardly leaves the midfield ""barren"". If anything, it allows for more men in midfield, when the wide AMs tuck in. Normally, the two DMs (one of which is usually more attack-minded) and the CAM form the core of the midfield. That's a 3-man midfield, like 4-3-3.

2) The CAM role is the only one that really suits Messi now, without leaving big holes in other parts of the pitch. Messi is not an ""inside forward"" even. He plays in the centre, plain and simple. Yes, he drifts, but his average position is very close to the middle, unlike someone like Neymar, Deulofeu, Demb√©l√©, etc.

Barca,"If you look around this sub you can find many of them but I'll bite:

- first and foremost he is coming from a league where he is dominating as the best player; soccer is a form sport and he is on high form the last year or so. Say what you want about the competitive level in the country, he's beating out other pretty good players and the confidence boost for his form is a real thing. 

- NT appearances have been positive, look at 5 goals in 5 games. He plays well for that great side, and before you say he has great players around him, he will at Barca too. He plays physically and more abrupt in his press with strong defensive work rate and also has good attacking positioning to get forward upfield. He can also put those attacking positions to use with a good shot.

- Good at set pieces which is a real stain of this Barca side that can get 10+ a game but convert so few (understanding of course we go short frequently) 

- someone to support and compete with Rakitic in the box to box position

Now if you want to talk about valuation that's an entirely different conversation that includes drivers such as (i) market timing for China which is midsession, (ii) seller reluctance as he is important to them, (iii) market shift post Neymar which has caused a material inflation to prices, (iv) poor operating leverage by Barca who just received an inflow of cash.

While there's nothing truly overt to suggest any kind of negligence or malintent, the fact that the board has repeatedly attempted to take ownership of and twist events in order to further their own interests (lying about Messi/Iniesta's contracts, possibly about negotiations with Liverpool) and disregarded the views of others suggests either they don't care about the interests of FC Barcelona as a whole, or in their perspective the interests and FC Barcelona's are one.

He cant be put in a fixed position because that would actually be his weakness and yes maybe the whole team may play better.....but they won't be an attacking threat because barca dont have creators anymore.

We saw a lot of that with Laporta. I was just answering a question that a fellow Redditor had with my personal opinion.

I have my reasons why I think this is not going to happen, or that if it happens by any chance it'll be extremely short lived just like it happened in 1934. I also think that there's a lot of misinformation regarding what would be the status quo of an independent Catalonia in Europe, and a lot of lies have been used by the independence movement leaders to attract more supporters. 2015 was supposed to be the big year for the independence with the first referendum... And yet, here we are. Recently the ANC leader suggested that each citizen donates 10‚Ç¨ to pay for the 5.000.000‚Ç¨ bail money for Mas for the costs of the previous referendum. This is fucking ridiculous. And look at today's session in the Parlament. Things are not being done according to democratic processes, because they seem to think the proc√®s is more important even than democracy. That's a dangerous thought, in my opinion.

Also, I'm not fucking off to Madrid's subreddit. The idea that you cannot support this team without somehow supporting the independence agenda is preposterous.",dmnoex9

We decided against signing Asensio few years back because Mallorca wanted the 4M upfront and we only offered installments because we were so money conscious. The board has claimed the reason they didn't buy any of their targets was because the market was so inflated. So knowing that, why would they pay 40M for a 29 year old? Can we atleast get some idealogical consistency?

I'm one of the ones that's not disappointed in Paulinho as a player. He could well prove to be a versatile backup for our midfield. But 40M is an exorbitant amount for a club that is so concerned with finances.",dmnl4n8

Barca,"In a court of law (which is what determines if the junta is corrupt or not, that they used the club for personal riches), there is no proof regarding corruption (so far). Ergo your CMV is non sequitur in the sense that there is nothing to change- because you are right in essence.

As a foreword, some people have called me out and sent me pms saying ""old senile soci"" which I am neither, because the manner in which I spoke seemed to indicate (to them) some sort of affinity for the current administration. Again, that is also untrue.

Yet I do feel that the hate is warranted and I agree the word choices such as ""corrupt"" are a little vile, and unrelated at times, yet the sentiment is obvious- it's not so much as the corruption as it is the lack of transparency, player unrest, former President in jail for the incoming transfer of *the* one outgoing player this summer, expensive but failed transfers, Cruyff being ousted, sporting success *seemingly* shunned in favor of something else (though it must be said if that's what the soci wants then soci gets)...all these ""complaints"" that people will have to call something. I mean if it walks and talks like a giraffe, you can call it a hippo, but we still *know* it's a giraffe.

Considering the big picture, it‚Äôs surprisingly only rational that people call the board corrupt or incompetent or what have you. If we made sense with our accusations then we should not really get involved over 22 grown ass men kicking a ball (although for Barcelona it is a different case).

As a tangent, just like the constitutional court of South Korea recently impeached their former President (who is now imprisoned) on the grounds that she did not act in the best interests of the country and did not uphold the constitution, not a single one of us in the 15 peaceful protests amassing to more than a few million people would have evidence on our hands that she was corrupt‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that she is. In addition the bigger prerogative is that the people asked her (repeatedly) to step down (on many grounds of‚Ä¶you said it ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù), then she should and must, regardless of the degree of her fault; the position itself dictates the presidency over the person‚Äîquite simply because the powers of the presidency are delegated by the citizens who elected her (at least that‚Äôs the zeitgeist of many a western constitutions- which we so cleverly adapted to after nine failed constitutions). For example, the clown constantly said she was not personally involved in the money laundering and other charges and suspicions, yet it doesn't matter-- when push comes to shove, that position entails responsibility not personal redemption or acquittal, and that in a holistic sense, ""the buck stops here."" She is still responsible for the random senior citizen that died on the street, and if she can't turn back time, the least she can do is step down. And that would be the least noble thing she could do: realizing that she is still responsible for a fault she did not personally commit. That's what the position is for. She didn't realize that and thus we impeached her. 

I often refrain from talking about politics in football, but Barca is not just football. It will be interesting to see how the vote of no confidence goes; we never expected the impeachment to pass the senate. If the socis don‚Äôt want Bartomeu anymore, they will have it their way because it quite literally says so and because they should‚Äîthe autonomy of ownership dictates it. Even Bartomeu is not foolish enough to think otherwise. That‚Äôs mes que un club, not unicef.",dmnj3a5

But this is mostly about Rosell. Only implications about Bartomeu so far is that he hanged on this deal tight and was defending it. He was also a vice-president during the time it was signed and I don't know currently if someone part of that board is still in current one besides Bartomeu. ",dmngkqb

Barca,"&gt; Firstly, however you want it to work, that's not how it works.

It's not going to work 100% like that, because there are a lot of uncertainties involved, negotiating skills, marketing value and of course the fact that performance can't be measured like wind speed or temperature. But I think the core of the philosophy I'm defending is perfectly possible.

&gt;Secondly, if you honestly think that Roberto or Denis can perform at Iniesta's level, you're sorely mistaken. Did you just watch Iniesta for Spain? When he's managed properly, he's still by far the best CM we have.

I didn't watch the game but do you honestly think you can take one game as a benchmark for Iniesta? Iniesta missed 19 games due to injury last season and has already been injured this season.

Also, what is ""properly managed""? Because if properly managed means playing him less (e.g. not more than 30-60 minutes), that has to be considered in his wage.

Top performance, even an amazing game, that's a secondary criterion for me. Titles are won over several games which add up to several thousand minutes. It's also a team sport, meaning that a midfielder playing amazing in attack role, is less amazing if he can't keep up with his defensive duties.

I'm much more interested in average performance over all games in the season, that's what puts you in the position to win places. And that's why I think Roberto or Denis are probably more valuable to the team right now.

Barca,"&gt;This guy is a legend and deserves better.

Better than what? Let's look at what Iniesta has achieved while playing for us: he has probably earned closer to 100m than 50m in wages and sponsorship deals, he owns a winery, he has lived a life tens of millions of kids dream about, won every title possible and the love a whole country. He has gotten standing ovations in the Santiago Bernab√©u.

There is not much more than ""better"" for Iniesta. He has profited just as much of the Club as the Club has from him. If we are gonna see less performance of him, it's fair that his wage sees a cut proportional to that.

And it's definitely a mistake to let him decide when to leave: that's something the club/coach has to decide as soon as he doesn't have the level to play for us (probably in a couple years), just like Pep did with Ronnie.",dmnb7zb

Regarding Alves, the problem with him was that we had no ""native"" for that position. Might have made sense to pay him 10m net, but if we had Semedo definitely not. 

Also, I'm not sure he was that great at Juve. My Italian friend said he was inconsistent, just as the years before with us. And at the end he played often as a midfielder afaik.

&gt;MSN. As long as Iniesta is willing to come on as a super-sub in quite a few games, like Henrik Larsson did in attack, I think he is worth the money.

He is worth the money depends on how much money we are talking about. 90%, 70% or 40% of his wage at his top level? I would say the latter... and with automatic reduction mechanisms.

The key issue: we should not compete with what a Chinese/Qatar club might offer, because they don't care about money or performance, while we need to be efficient as possible to win the UCL.",dmnaycs

Honestly, is there any argument to not do so?

I accept that he should get more if having him around has a tangible positive impact on the Club's revenue, although Im sceptic on that because that younger players could have that impact too if they get a chance to evolve and ultimately, you get that by winning.",dmnam2l
Barca,"No, sorry: I meant subbing Deulo at around the 60' mark, and then shifting Dembele to the right so Denis plays on the left for the last half-hour.

&gt; You make it sound like he plays on a team full of amateurs. It's not like he plays for Gibraltar or Kyrgyzstan or something like that.

&gt; The amount of comments from plastic Barca fans on the post-match thread were embarrassing. Saying how Argentina always let Messi down etc and acting like the whole squad bar Messi are amateurs.

&amp;nbsp;

Responding to above:
&gt; You actually have a good point. Many Barca fans are really just Messi fans and they want Argentina to win just so Messi can have his World Cup. They would rather Argentina win than their own damn countries smh


&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Messi has an incredible amount of talent around him. Without all of that talent, Messi wouldn't have been to a WC Final or back to back Copa America Finals. If he was from some truly terrible footballing nation, he might not even qualify for the World Cup.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; It is NEVER Messi's fault.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Did the messi anus defenders make excuses for him when they lost to juventus and got shut out over two games. Can't remember

&amp;nbsp;

All with considerate number of upvotes, man I knew that r/soccer hated Barca but this is just hilarious, I'm done! I swear people didn't even watches the games from Argentina.

Barca,"It is not popular to buy players in January because most top players are CL bound,",dmn6mip
Barca,"People are far too harsh on him. He was our 2nd best CB in his 1st year, and contributed a lot to the team and its success. After that, he declined fairly rapidly. Again, not his fault, just age catching up with him, with Enrique's poor tactics not helping.",dmn6grd
Barca,"Iniestas top level is certainly much higher than those of Denis Suarez, and also better than Sergi Roberto. People were saying exactly the same thing about Dani that you are writing about Iniesta. He played awfully for Barcelona only to be one of Juventus star players last year. Iniesta didn't have a good season last year, but lucho's system diminished the midfield brilliance and solely focused on MSN. As long as Iniesta is willing to come on as a super-sub in quite a few games, like Henrik Larsson did in attack, I think he is worth the money. He, like Larsson, can really change a game.",dmn6cn9
Barca,"This is a fair assessment. I wouldn't mind seeing Denis and Messi's sub either (in the CAM role). Iniesta, Roberto, and Paulinho are the options to accompany/replace Busquets (well, Iniesta can't replace Busquets, but the other two can in lesser games).",dmn6cfp

Barca,"No, I don't think Iniesta doesn't care about his paycheck, I'm sure he does especially towards the twilight of his career. That's not quite what I mean though. We've had numerous contract renewals in past years. Do you remember the players and board being this out of sync before? Usually it's all smiles and photo ops. Something just feels out of whack this time and nobody is going out of their way to confirm otherwise. Getting that photo op with Messi or Iniesta signing would be a feel good moment in these shit times. If everybody was on the same page, they would have done it already to boost morale. It just feels like nobody wants to give this management any help in the PR department. ",dmn5tn8
Barca,"The logic is that they have been trying to become independent since a loooooooooooong time ago(+100 years) and they never got it, I doubt this will change ",dmn4vrk
Barca,"&gt; Exactly this. We could say all sorts of things about Neymar's motivations but Lio and Iniesta are not in doubt.

Do you honestly think Iniesta does not have salary expectations? And that these expectations might be too high?

I hate this board as much as you do, but IF (!) they are beeing *reasonably* tough on Iniesta about the new contract, I'd consider that one of those rare occasions where they have gotten it right.  Iniesta 2017 is not Iniesta 2009 and Iniesta 2018 will be worse, so the contract must be adjusted accordingly.

Now I'm assuming it's a money issue and that Barto is beeing reasonable, which might not be the case, of course.

(Reasonable for me is that Iniesta shouldn't be earning more than Denis Suarez or Sergi Roberto, as these are likely to be important players this year and have a lot of potential while Iniesta can't play more than 60 minutes and his performance will only decline.)",dmn4a3z
Barca,"I wouldn't say that's the most likely scenario. Polls suggest very decent levels of participation and a comfortable ""Yes"" win. The Catalan government has said it will declare independence unilaterally regardless of participation too.",dmn494v

* Polls suggest a comfortable win for pro-independence.

We're pretty much fuked seeing how we won't be able to get replacements to make up for his loss. Xavi leaving Barca changed everything for us. Now imagine MESSI leaving. We can't splash out 300 million that we don't have to replace the GOAT. Best case scenario we sell him for his buyout clause in 2-3 years and do the best we can to make up for his loss.,dmn0bk5

The double pivot should be busquets + 1 depending on the game. Iniesta against tighter deeper defenses, roberto/paulinho if energy and runs into the box are needed, rakitic for bigger games where we're fighting for possession (gomes if we wanna lose).
I think the 433 just isn't working anymore messi keeps being forced to drop deeper to get play going and abandoning the right wing in the process. Playing with a double pivot and 2 wingers means play will be stretched giving messi more room to work with and play a free role which suits him so well.",dmmxcfe

Barca,I guess he's pretty close to be the best in universe even.,dmmo99v
Barca,"Argentina depend too much on messi. He literally plays the role of 3 players smh. I think the role of the coach is to get Messi in positions where he is most dangerous, not dropping so deep to do everything on his own.",dmmo8j5
Barca,The pass to Beneditto at around 8:05 and what happened afterwards is so bizarre. An absolutely magical through ball and the other guy just kicks it out of play! It encompasses the total gulf in class between Messi and the rest of the team. Can someone post a gif of that to r/soccer to make everyone understand why Messi alonse can't take the team to victory?,dmmo6j2
Barca,"Really great to watch him cause so many problems for Venezuela. He picked up the ball in the midfield, eluded multiple tackles and played a divisive pass many times. He took the ball down both wings on multiple occasions beating the outside back and getting the ball central. And he was making runs behind the back line. Truly the most versatile attacker in the world. ",dmmnzvj
Barca,Yea we dont need moneymar to confirm that.,dmmnnn7

Barca,Only one who performe for Argentina. ,dmmm6u0
Barca,"What do I want him to say? Myself and the board resign effective immediately.

What do I expect him to say? Exactly this.

Our expectations of what the board would say has nothing to do with the validity of these press statements as propaganda. When you resort to these tactics of manipulation, it means you are desperate for resolve. ",dmmluw6

Barca,45% conversion rate over 7 years though. That's ridiculous,dmmlbaf
Barca,Fyi they put 4-5 people on messi and he still created chance after chance whole match. Others can't even trap the ball and shoot properly wtf. Just WTF im so frustrated,dmmk30i

Barca,What happened is the club is suing him and not giving him 25 million. Thus begins and ends the source of his new found crusade.,dmmhzav
Barca,"Yeah, but whether you like it or not, his comments hold more weight because he was an actual first team member. Something happened that we're not aware of.",dmmh231

Barca,"Sampaoli has been brought in too late. He will probably shape up this team,  but there isn't enough time. They never should have wasted their time with Bauza. ",dmmcndc
Barca,"I'm too fucking sad about Messi not making it to World Cup. I've watched two Argentinian qualifiers under Sampaoli, the team is full of trash tier players around Messi, the substitutions make no fucking sense, this team isn't winning the rest of the 2 qualifiers. Fucking hell, you don't deserve this Leo :(",dmmcgal
Barca,"If the team wins, Real Madrid loses. I don't care if the board stays as long as we keep winning Ligas and being strong contenders for Champions.",dmmce2l

Barca,Aaah that makes it seem somewhat more human lol,dmmc45w
Barca,Messi would have 2 World Cup wins if he played for Spain.,dmmc2kp
Barca,"I agree in this shape they will get smashed in the world cup even if they somehow magically qualify. I had my hopes up things would get better, but even if Sampaoli is capable of turning the tables, it won't be fast it seems. Everything is wrong in their play, the passes suck af, they can't position, they can't group, Messi is the only person (aka alien) trying to create something different from a casual cross, he pulls out some truly genius passes trying to create, only to get them truly wasted by someone supposedly good and experienced like Pastore... It's like they don't care at all, I really cannot comprehend why.",dmmc1y4
Barca,*shots on goal. That makes it a bit less ridiculous,dmmc09d
Barca,Luisito scoring the oddest of goals yet missing clearest of chances,dmmbuyt
Barca,Can't have been as bad as the USA v Honduras game :(,dmmbua3
Barca,"Exactly!! Because you know the likes of Di Maria, Dybala and Pastore should be capable of collecting his absolutely perfect passes! Is that so much to ask of these supposedly talented players? I'm beyond frustrated
 If this is the state of things, it may be best they don't qualify. I don't think I can handle the stress of a nother heartbreaking tournament for Messi tbh. ",dmmbriq
Barca,"When I was there I just showed up at the Camp Nou a couple hours before the game and it took me like 10 minutes to get a ticket. It was expensive mind, since this was a UCL semi final against Real. So I don't expect you'll have any issues. ",dmmbpb9
Barca,.. nevermind Uruguay just scored,dmmblul
Barca,"I don't think I was so furious for my own NT recently, maybe because I expect nothing of them soon so I only get nice surprises at times. But watching Argentina with Messi like that is painful af.",dmmbl5j

Barca,Even when he is 40 with price tag 1 billion Pound. I'll not.,dmmbjdm
Barca,Sooooooooo sad to watch,dmmbhzm
Barca,That was atrocious. ,dmmbhnz
Barca,"How is he in the top flight? Been absolutely abysmal. There is no hope for this NT, watching lio struggle like that is rough.
How does this shake out now that Bolivia won and Uruguay might be drawing?",dmmbh3g
Barca,"Obviously, I'm not counting Messi as a striker. Who are the three you're thinking about. Because Asensio is better than Suarez and Dembele as a pure goalscorer. Luis is declining rapidly.",dmmbbo6
Barca,And I thought Icardi was wasteful. This guy couldn't even stop a ball if his life depended on it.,dmmbafk
Barca,Messi is the most unlucky person with NT ever. Seriously.,dmmb7hy
Barca,It's pathetic how Messi is the one creating spaces and chances but no one in Argentina can take advantage of them.,dmmb37u

Barca,MD propaganda. Fuck the old socis. Fuck the cunts who voted for him and will vote for him again.,dmm9z1x
Barca,I have the feeling that bartomeu is waiting for the vote to gain significant ground then crush it to look superior and make it harder for the socis and members to believe that they can overthrow this board before 2021,dmm9jt0
Barca,"They just scored so fucking easily. 55 minutes and they barely try, but wake up after a goal. For fucks sake they're so unmotivated",dmm9a0s
Barca,"It's fucking unbelievable. Even with sampaoli the team is fucking shit.... I feel so bad for Messi, apparently no one other than Messi gives a shit about Argentina",dmm9879
Barca,I can't believe this stupid fucking shitty team losing 1-0 to Venezuela. Fuck off. ,dmm90ad
Barca,"What is wrong with Argentina? So many stars, yet Messi is caring it all. Everyone other than Messi is playing mediocre at best.",dmm8tw9
Barca,"&gt;If we had a striker that had 1/10 The ability of Asensio, 

What? We have 3 forwards better than him. Sure, he's an amazing player but why say shit like this? ",dmm8nca
Barca,"If you listen to the actual interview he says that he ""decided with his agent and his wife to leave the team because he thought he wouldn't play much. There are more experienced players that would take minutes from him"" 

He was also asked if the club forced him out and he said that ""going to Nice is the best thing for him and the club right now""

Then he says that Valverde is a good tactician, etc. And he hopes to come back to the club sooner or later.

Valverde should have talked to him, no doubt, but he sounds like he had made up his mind without even talking to him. Maybe Valverde didn't talk to him, because he actually planned on using him.

Also, you're branding him as a ""yes man"" over a tweet taken out of context and your perception of him. What's with that? Too early to tell what kind of coach he is.",dmm8kk8

Barca,"A club like Bayern is too big to keep a player against his wishes. Not saying that Thiago would want to make the switch. Just saying that if he did, Bayern would probably demand a good fee, but let him go. ",dmm4zim
Barca,"&gt;but always contributed well.  
  
Literally wrong. No one made more individual errors than him, and he was extremely inconsistent. Not saying he never was good either, he definitely was at times, but he didn't always contribute well. ",dmm4y6e
Barca,"He wasn't amazing, he had amazing moments (2), but he was still inconsistent when he played. Good at best in his first season, but the other two were horrific.  
  
EDIT: Tell me what's wrong with this comment, I'd like to know. Are we suddenly starting to overrate how ''good'' Mathieu was now? ",dmm4vke
Barca,"He was acceptable the first season, but 15/16 and 16/17 he one of our worst players in each. He was incredibly injury prone, and extremely inconsistent. Whenever you started him or subbed him on, you never know if he'd get the job done or just simply be garbage. Not reliable in away.  
  
He was never fantastic, but got to credit him for two vital goals. I still think we never should've signed him though.",dmm4u9d
Barca,"Is it a Barca clause or something? Because there's no way in hell Juve would accept 90M. But anways, I think he should be a target next season to rotate and then replace Su√°rez.",dmm4kog
Barca,This board won't hire someone that does the unexpected or that will challenge them. Think Sampaoli or Pep would accept this shit? They'd be on their way before the summer was over. Bielsa would probarly quit after a day.,dmm4gdu
Barca,"I don't believe that in the slightest. He publicly asked for players to be signed, he won't say no when presented the oppertunity. Only seems like media games to divert blame onto Valverde if you ask me.",dmm4cy7
Barca,The hell is going on at this club..,dmm49a7
Barca,"FFS the transfer window just closed, give me a break!",dmm3u56
Barca,"First off you need to watch more Thiago, him along with Isco are the future of Spain having proven much in the u21's they are better than Veratti, but I'll admit Veratti is good, Rafinha and Denis have a lot to prove but I'm all for keeping them 

Second Thiago left because we weren't giving him enough playing time, it was a clause he had that if not given enough playing time his release clause could be triggered and a cheaper price, I love this club but we screwed up here, we didn't show enough faith in him and we should've watched out for the clause. We need to stop acting like it's his his fault and he should've waited, he's honestly proven to Barca he was ready.

I think they're could be a possibility in him coming back if we get rid of this board. Next season, hopefully once we get rid of this board, we should prioritize getting Thiago.",dmm3t7o

Barca,"Argentina and Chile were tied on points with the same amount of matches played before today, but Chile was ahead on goal differential.

Barca,Did Brazil drawing today help Argentina? ,dmm1yc5
Barca,The difference between when he last left Bar√ßa and what he's shown since coming back is night and day. Looks to me like we have your club to thank for that. ,dmm1wg6
Barca,More Bolivia mate. They did Argentina a big favor tonight.,dmm15l8

Barca,I just do t understand why everything is the boards fault. It's at a point where it's childish to complain about every and anything that Madrid might have superior and blame it on the board ,dmlz97y
Barca,"I've been a soci of this club for the past 20 years, I want my club to be well managed and not being a laughingstock of the place: is that too much to ask?

You know what? I'll drop to your level. FC Dudelange is a very unique club too, why don't you go support them instead?",dmlz60v
Barca,We would have if he wanted to leave,dmlz5rr
Barca,"Yeah fantastic, usually when you put a sticker price on player it's because you are a selling club. Now then, do we have a better selling history than Madrid? 

And FFS please, the increase in release clause for Neymar's last renewal was seen as deterrent. If no why would Mestre tell everyone that he was sure at 200% that the Brazilian would be staying?

It might not mean a shit to you, but I actually pay money every fucking year to see my club being well managed and staying competitive. The board is our employees, and yes I like to bitch about the mismanagement when I see it. ",dmlyxs0
Barca,I agree. He should be concerned with PSG now and not our board. Wonder what he has to say (or probably will in few yrs) about Nasser way to doing things. ,dmlytcv
Barca,"The problem is benchmarking to anyone at all. Barca are unique, why should they be compared to a rival or anybody else? This is a club that let Villa leave for peanuts so that he could continue playing, this is a style that makes players want to come here.

If you just want to be Madrid so bad than why don't you go support them? ",dmlyt48
Barca,Yeah I'm really excited to see where EV uses him this year. Hopefully he can break in the starting lineup somewhere.,dmlyscu
Barca,"Unrelated... 

You agree to an original contract; Madrid sign players at lower starting wages and high release clauses. 

Player perform well and get an extension, this leads to negotiations in which both wages and releases clauses rise. So when Sergi Roberto for example is renewed, and they want to raise his clause and extra $100mm h might agree but only if his wages go up and additional $x. 

The way that Barca pay the players  higher than Madrid and the way that Madrid have higher release clauses are unrelated to this particular discussion, the key point is that if you want to raise a release clause, on either end, it requires other contractual concessions like longer duration or higher wage 

",dmlyouf
Barca,Some clubs (like real) view a release as a deterrent. Others view it as the sticker price. Barcelona is one of them. I don't love it because it leaves the squad vulnerable but I also don't care to keep rooting on players who want to leave. Yea ok the board is not great but fucking get over it. You guys bitch about internal politics almost more than arsenal fans. ,dmlylza
Barca,"... Well if you don't set your benchmark on your supposed rival, what is going to be your benchmark? You want us to be what the pericos are to us?

Ronaldo 1 billion release clause at his signing was a joke because at that time no club in the world would be able to put 200m in a player. Ceballos, Isco, Marco Asensio getting 700m clause is not a joke but it's adapting to the market conditions since you have state backed countries willing to pour hundred of millions on a single player.

I have no knowledge of how they negotiate, but the results of these negotiations are plain to see for everyone. ",dmlyfzs
Barca,"I usually disagree with her most of the time, but nothing wrong here.",dmlyef8
Barca,"but this isn't true. Madrid's players have lower wages than Barca players. Mathieu, Turan and Paco had a higher wage than Marcelo, Carvajal, and Isco ffs. ",dmly7w3
Barca,"Not at all, it's about precedent documentation.

When you sign an extension you open up the document to negotiate certain points, with the precedent used as the starting place. Madrid's original co tracts with hear guys always had high releases (like too high to trigger) so they continued to be high where as Barca always have fair release clauses. 

Look I have no knowledge of how the board negotiates contracts and neither do you. This whole witch hunt of blaming the bird for anything that is less than Madrid is ridiculous. ",dmly4o9
Barca,He has turned La Masia into a fast-food restaurant for other clubs to enjoy. It is all about making money for this board. It is seriously depressing...,dmly2mq
Barca,So they're trying to change now? Just get out. ,dmly2jf
Barca,we wouldn't have sold him tho,dmly267
Barca,I'm sorry but he's the main reason why I watch the club play he gives it a meaning the creativity I don't know who else has it like him. I'd hate to see him go. If he moved to the midfield hopefully he'll stay for another 2-3 years ,dmlxxyb
Barca,"&gt; Transfers will be handled by a commission that includes Segura, Bartomeu and Mestre instead of a sporting directorate


What?! So transfers will be entirely handled by corrupt businessmen with NO input from anyone even remotely competent in football management? Why would you even hire a manager if you don't intend to listen to his opinions on what players he needs to pursue his game plan? These fucking people are driving me insane. This ""masterplan"" sounds great if you want the club to crash and burn, which must be what they're planning. I'll drink with you. ",dmlxwfu
Barca,"Well fuck me, contract negotiations are beyond the ability of the board. Glad to know that. ",dmlxt56
Barca,"So you are telling me that people like Cristiano Ronaldo, Bale, James Rodriguez etc. Are less intelligent than Neymar&amp;Co.? I mean they did sign contract with absurd release clause amount without having much more wages than Barcelona's players, so where lies the problem? Is that because they are stupid? Or because the people who negotiate contracts in Barcelona are far worse than those in Madrid?",dmlxqpz
Barca,His first year was okay. Bartra level football. The next 2 years were really bad and he cost us several points on LW.,dmlxmt3
Barca,The way Messi is fit he will still play like a 23 year old when 36 mate. And even after his physics degrade he will still have the most accurate foot and game vision. ,dmlxkt0
Barca,"He was solid and served his purpose. A great center back with speed and strength but not a tactical genius, which is what Barca need in Mascherano, Pique, etc. He gave us depth in our treble-winning season and helped us win it all, scoring a goal against Madrid (I believe) that was critical to break a deadlock and win. He was played out of position at LB against Juve, made mistakes in that and a few other games and ultimately lost the support of the fans. I think people criticize him irrationally and he served us well. He is not at the crazy-high level of expectations we expect from our players but he was solid and did his job.",dmlxii5
Barca,"I wouldnt let 31 year old Messi go for 300m. He will still be the best for at least 3-4 more years and one of the best as long as he wants to continue play. 
With the marketing and trohpy money they would have their 300m back in a few years.",dmlxhte
Barca,"True but higher release clause gives you a leeway, for instance you won't end up with 220m out of nowhere, in panic of looking for a replacement and having all the clubs trying to rob you blind. When you steer the ship however you want, you can agree that the player's want out and prepare for it (meaning recruiting before having a cursed gift of 220m)  before its official. ",dmlxhrk
Barca,"Still scary knowing we can lose him whenever he wants and for ""only"" 300m.",dmlxepm
Barca,"Yeah sure Ceballos must be earning more than Messi since his release clause is much higher.

There is something that is called negotiations, a skill that must be absent from our directing board portfolio of competence. ",dmlxbsd
Barca,"That's not true, technically he is very good. If you look at highlights of him he gives amazing passes. His problem is confidence: always playing the easy pass, hesitating to bomb forward to help out the attack, not pressing hard for fear of being caught out of position. He is just playing safe, but if you look at his games in the CDM position against Atleti and LCM against Man. City he was very good. The thing is, he is afraid to take risks because he knows the first thing he does the fans will whistle him. It's hard to really do anything when the fans will heckle you regardless.",dmlx9jb
Barca,"&gt; Transfers will be handled by a commission that includes Segura, Bartomeu and Mestre instead of a sporting directorate
&gt; They're blaming Lucho for the transfers of Turan and Vidal, so the manager will be less involved in future decisions

This is why I argued that even if Valverde requested certain players, his opinion will not matter if the Bartomeu and his cronies want to spend the money elsewhere. You can bet your ass it was the board pushing for Coutinho instead of analyzing for contingency options in case it fell through. 

As a side, I'm really surprised they've started to blame Lucho. Next on the list will probably be Cruyff. This board has no shame.",dmlx6qu
Barca,[deleted],dmlwwx4
Barca,damn he is way more childish than I thought tf,dmlwvg0
Barca,"Yep, Denis has only played a bit at CM this season so far. To be fair though, Messi hasn't played on the wing at all this season either. At least not in actuality. If we play a 4-2-3-1, then I can imagine Denis fulfilling Messi's role as CAM.",dmlwmk6
Barca,"He was a good contributor in a time when the team needed a CB. He knew he was being signed as a 3rd/4th in the depth chart but always contributed well. Fans probably hold his recent poor performances against him, but part of the issue was tactical coaching issues. He did make mistakes but, again, he wasn't the big money savior type signing. He was also the fastest player on the squad, which is the type of thing that means more in training to drive the other players than any sort of on field impact. 

Make no mistake he's no David Villa, but he's also no Alex Song. He came and did exactly what he was bought for and never made any negative press.

For me he was a great success and the model of an older signing to fill a void. ",dmlwcaa
Barca,Yeah that's what I thought last year when he played CM but unfortunately EV hasn't given him many minutes there. I'm probably seeing the similarities with Messi now just because he's been playing on the wing.,dmlwc3f
Barca,"Was good the first year we got him, then started to decline. 

I got a soft spot when I read apparently he paid part of his own transfer to move here.",dmlw4z3
Barca,"Yay, let's go Brazil. Vamos, Neymar, Coutinho and **Lord Paulinho** . I need Argentina in Rusia pls",dmlw015
Barca,"True and I agree with you, just want to add that it's not really the same though. For instance if Neymar wanted to leave and had just 10m release clause, the new club would just have to pay the 10m and Neymar could get a bigger signing bonus and higher salary instead, no need to pay higher than 10m since that's the release clause.

Barca,Messi is 30 and he'll play until he is at least 31. Messi is the greatest ever but (hypothetically) getting three 23 year old prodigies for 100 million each will surely add far more value than Messi would at 31. Messi retiring at Barca would mean his value simply disappeared. Is him staying for 2 years really worth the 300 million that could insure Barca for another 10 years? Even Veratti and Dybala combined would add comparable value but that value would persist for ~10 years while Messi's will be 2-3 max. Anyone who thinks such additions cannot win a CL given Messi's exclusion is deluded. Not to mention that by that time it is more than likely Coutinho would have arrived and therefor we'd have a Busquets/Veratti/Coutinho/Dembele/Suarez/Dybala team. Looks like a way better team than Messi+mediocre midfielders as far as I am concerned.,dmlvl3c

The core of Pique - Busquest - Iniesta - Messi - Suarez is still phenomenal, and wheter we end up winning trophies will depend on the performance of the surrounding players. The difference is that it's the first time in a while that Real Madrid has an indisputable better squad, but they also have players that may not perform well (Benzema, Bale, Varane, some of the subs...) so we can compete with them.

The difference between Valencia or Deportivo and Barcelona is much higher that the difference between Madrid and Barcelona.",dmle8gy

Managing to record record revenues will mean little in the wrong run if people don't like working or playing here. The values that we should be striving for are shunned in favor of something else and the lack of transparency is a clear issue; at least with Laporta we knew the bullshit but people were happier then so we took the good with the bad (yes I know Laporta almost got Beckham instead of Dinho and almost went for Mou instead of Pep but he delegated those decisions to those who knew best- one of which ironically was Rosell's work in bringing Ronaldinho). In short, the politics is nothing new, it was here from the very beginning and it is here now, will be in the future, it is here to stay and while sporting wise it may not be the days of Gaspart the signs are worrying and I hope the socis can oust the board, even if the odds look bleak.

Barca,"&gt; Idk what this is supposed to mean, Suarez is way more spirited then those two players and way better.

suarez was. the point is he was top man 2 years ago and has a very noticeable decline. i say vardy because watching him play as a solo striker, he makes some runs that has the potential to be lethal not that i care for vardy or kane, but someone who isnt too chill and ready to bust a run. pistolero doesnt do that anymore, not since last 2 seasons he just waits for messi. 

hyperbole? did you not watch last season? he and neymar [messed up so many chances(neymar more)](https://youtu.be/NhYX3pVgQws?t=1m43s). Messi we need someone who can hustle not a chill player. Im kinda seeing a turan  type of attitude. but i believe he can change if hes he wants to.

No, it explicitely says: ""The contract's signed, it's valid from the month of June, from June 30""

So according to this moronic logic of yours:

Luka Modric should go back to Croatia and play for Zagreb to ""make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies.""

Toni Kroos should go back to Germany to play for Bayern and ""make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies.""

Casemiro should go back to Brazil to play for Sao Paulo and ""make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies.""

Cristiano Ronaldo should go back to Portugal and play for Sporting and ""make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies.""

Kovacic should to back to Croatia to play for Zagreb and ""make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies.""

Varane should go back to France and play for RC Lens and ""make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies.""

realmadrid,"That's sports in general. When you perform you're lauded as one of the greats but as soon as you start to lose everyone is after you. This is especially true for madrid because we've been so dominant and the team is constantly under the microscope of everyone. Start of the season shows this well, Zidane's job position was being questioned, pretty much the future of the whole midfield was  being questioned as well as keylors and the whole attacking front as well where we've seen reports of Ronaldo wanting to leave and the whole Ronaldo to PSG, Neymar to Madrid rumors also.

What's more, is that the team players are not necessarily shoving how many titles they have into everyone's faces, but they consistently project the culture of winning and greatness (exactly what I think you should show playing for Madrid) but people don't really like someone who isn't humble while dominating. It's one of the reasons why everyone hates Ronaldo and love Messi, while both are undeniably the greatest of all time in their own respect, you have two polarizing demeanors and Messi's demeanor is just a lot more acceptable to an average fan. It's a popularity competition for the majority of fans in football.",dyi5sc1

Usually I'm too busy screaming to pay attention, but I think it has to do with everyone and their mother going foward and trying to score at least once in a while (namely Case and Marcelo).

Probably is the diamond, probably we take more goals than we should due to miscomunications, etc.

In a world where money was infinity and there wasn't FFP, I would rather have De Gea due to the way he ""tackles"" (I don't know the English term for leaving the goal). I.e. if De Gea came for free like Courtois is trying to come, well, I would take that. We don't live in that world. I think Navas is an awesome GK and I would rather see Flo focusing on a striker instead of De Gea.",dyhukco
realmadrid,"I don't think OP meant it as a circlejerk. Zindane is the best manager in the world of Soccer, you can't really argue against it.

I don't think he even meant it as a comparison, there is absolutely no comparison between the two. Different leagues, different tactics, different teams, different backgrounds, different milestones, and different goals. 

I think what he does mean is that if Real Madrid were to lose the cup, Klopp will be hailed king of all that is Soccer for eternity, whereas Zidane winning it just means he's lucky 3 times in a row with virtually the same team.

realmadrid,"Agreed. I think the Zidane impact is comparable. The team now compared to Ancelotti or Ben√≠tez is considerably better. 

That being said, I remember reading on this sub a long time ago when ZZ won his first champions as a manager that perhaps his success is an indication of a new approach to hiring managers. Zidane is an entirely homegrown coach, kind of like Del Bosque was. 

And I do not mean because he was a Madrid legend. In addition to that status, he has an incomparable institutional awareness in Madrid. As in, he¬¥s been in the club¬¥s ranks post-player in several positions and has observed the modus operandi of the club from every perceivable, relevant angle. 

I think hiring an individual with this CV is infinitely preferable to hiring a coach from another team or league that has won 3 or 4 titles. Even with minimal coaching experience before managing the top team, ZZ knows better than anyone, even Florentino, what the instrumental components to Madrid's success are. I think we should stick to this approach. ",dyhtg3e

Starting from managing a top team puts even more pressure on you when you go to another team.

realmadrid,"Zidane won all his titles hithertho with Ben√≠tez¬¥s players. He has spent virtually 0 euros, honestly. I see your point, though. Madrid has more spending power and they start off in a much better position than Liverpool merely because they *are* Madrid. 

I agree with what you are saying, but that does not diminish Zidane's accomlpishments in the least. If he had come, and like Guardiola, made sweeping line-up changes (2009 Bar√ßa) or broke the bank like Mourinho at Manchester United, then I would agree wholeheartedly. He merely adapted, very successfully, the players that were already there.

I think being succesful at a club like Madrid or Bar√ßa would infinitely have more merit precisely because of the status of the club as a mandatory finalist, if not winner of all competitions. 

The lockeroom full of world-class players that, more often than not, the manager has to convince them to respect him. The board demanding consistent, convincing success. The press and the expectations work against you. Even when you succeed, there is more criticism than praise. ""Why didn't James play? Why didn't Benzema score? Madrid only has 3 clean-sheets this season, so do you prefer Kepa or De Gea? Is Zidane doing his best to accomodate Bale?"" These are Madrid problems and they do not come just from the press, they come from the directiva as well - who do you think owns the press?. Even when Zidane won the league and champions league, the press and the board wanted more (""y la copa, qu√©?"". 

He has to succeed and meet/exceed their standards with the players they personally prefer. Because there will always be headlines with ""What will it take for Madrid to win a treble?"" until they do and then they'll ask about the sextete. ",dyhrmej

Right now he‚Äôs doing a great job, but it‚Äôs certainly easier when you have access to some of the best players in the world. More important than talent, there are several players on RM with strong mentality. CR, Ramos, navas, are players that make a huge difference in games.

Reyes scored 2 goals and Diarra scored 1. We even were behind 0\-1. Beautiful game.

If you can read plays and pass with accuracy or do small fakes to interrupt, NOT intercept (didn‚Äôt mention this at all) the opposition‚Äôs press you‚Äôre avoiding yourself altogether of getting bullied off the ball.",dyhl8dv
realmadrid,"Yeah as much as I like Zizou this comparison is unfair as fuck. Klopp managed to win the Bundesliga in a time when it was dominated by Bayern. Reaches the UCL final with a team that he himself had built and even crushed our boys. 

Now, ever since he took over Liverpool they have turned from a team struggling to get into the top 4 teams of England with queationable purchases to a powerhouse with probably the best attacking trio in the world atm.

The man is knows how to build a team and his tactics are really good.

And lastly, attended/won finals is not a good measurement of the skill of a manager. Anything can happen in a single match and sometimes there are situations no manager can prevent.

Zidane is great, I agree. But please give credit where is due. Klopp has definetely earned the credit ro his name",dyhl3i5

realmadrid,"let‚Äôs not get cocky. i understand it will be very difficult for him, but we can do the talking after the match.",dyhcfb5
realmadrid,"It's not a problem with his running, cause he covers a lot of distance during games. The big problem is he can be a defensive liability many a times and has a knack of switching off at times especially when we aren't controlling the game. Counters are a nightmare for him cause he's usually off position to defend them and doesn't have the legs to track back easily to make up. At his position, we need a 2 way player and our front 5-6 is usually pretty offensive that he needs to do a good defensive job which he struggles to do cause he doesn't have the defensive awareness and discipline to be a solid rock in a deep role consistently. Let's not forget he played a much more attacking role for Bayern and usually had multiple mids behind him to cover. 


And it's not just him, our side lacks defensive discipline in general and we do switch off many a times defensively. The amount of goals we've conceded is no mere coincidence. I hope the club realizes how poor the defense has been and decides to bring in a change in culture. A big reason Barca has won the league is cause of their defense and we need to rectify it if we want to challenge next season.",dyhca0m

realmadrid,"I have always loved Benzema and the way he combines with Ronaldo. We consider his value to the team, not as a striker but the overall value he brings to attack. But I think Eden Hazard is a better creator and also can play anywhere in the attack, either wing, central or as false striker also. Also, he is the best player I have seen who can receive the ball on the turn and his back facing towards the goal. I always our way of playing football, but most of the time we don't penetrate through the middle, we combine nicely than launch it to our fullbacks. Isco is the players who dribble well, but he doesn't do it on purpose all the time. I have been watching Chelsea matches due to this man only, but I would love to see him with intelligent players. In Chelsea his link up with only Fabregas is breath-taking,  but here in Madrid we have so many intelligent players and we keep the possession, so he would be an ideal candidate for me. He has always admired Zidane, and neither does he has any ego whatsoever. I believe his link up with Ronaldo will be on fire, better than Benzema I can say on the basis that the way he combines with Giroud or Morata and they have played together for 6 months to the 1-year maximum. One criticism I often hear of him is that he is not consistent enough, I do think it's valid to some extent, but in big games, Chelsea never like to keep possession of the ball, so he has less impact but still, he always has those magical moments which turns the match in seconds. What is your opinion please do share, and I don't think we are utilizing the bale, so should he voluntarily go to EPL, as it would be best for him to not waste his prime years on bench.",dyha9wh

realmadrid,"Goalkeepers (and strikers) all over are more easy to blame for a bad performance. If you lose a match when you did not score more than 1 than the striker/winger (in our case) is to blame because they are the center point of attack. If you lose a match when you concede more than 1 then your goalkeeper is to blame, because they are the center point of defense.

If your team loses then again one of those two (goalkeeper or striker depending upon the score) is usually credited for the win.

The fact of the matter is that having the best Spanish players is a big thing for Madrid, It's why they overpay on young Spanish talent so when a chance to get the current Spanish number 1 comes up they go after him and don't mind tossing aside the guy from Costa Rica who has been a great servant to the club.

But also it's much easier to just say the goalkeeper should've done better in a particular situation, since taking the roles of defenders into consideration requires more knowledge.

surprisingly, this works and I don't understand why. It's 2027 in my journeyman save, although I started with badges and at a club, and I haven't really lasted long anywhere.

Almost done with my third season at Volendam, I broke upon realising I couldn't replicate the second season and left. The journey took me to Estudiantes where I had a fun few in game days before having another fun few ingame days at Turkey before having another fun few in game days at Sociedad. Holland was where I won my second price, the EC, with the three strikers exploit, because I'm not that good. After that I went to Ajax where I got rid of the system and tried to create my own. I was 8th when I let my assistant take over the last month, who made the national EL playoffs by ending seventh. He got eliminated. I left, embarrassed. A scar in my illustrious career. Now I'm at Torina, where I'm 7th in march.

For example, people on this sub have been calling for Navas' head (for whatever reason, idk) for a long time, but I've always thought he was super solid and has the best reaction saves out of any of the top gk's. But if I post after a single bad game or bad moment he had, the response is ""look guys, just another Navas hater!"" or ""just another post bashing Navas."" (this is just an example, applies to Isco and Benzema too)!

If someone has a single bad game, and there are 3 posts talking about them, for the next 6 months the sub has this ""we hate that player"" vibe until they do something amazing to change it.",dyg3ymb

They are the same players that have won with us the last few years. The whole team had a dip in form earlier in the year, and the defense was no exception.

So... we should get rid of Sergio Ramos, Carvajal &amp; Marcelo instead for signing an actual WC GK who is consistent to bail his team out. Just look at Oblak &amp; Ter Stegen, they are **huge reason** why Barcelona and Atleti are very good defensive numbers and doing so well in LaLiga.",dyg2xsy

realmadrid,"I don't watch Brazil so I couldn't tell you. I can tell you that Firmino is better than Jesus from their playing time in the Premier League, can't speak on their time with Brazil. It could be that Firmino played for a small bundesliga team and never played in Brazil, it could be because Jesus has performed well for the national team.  Seems pretty irrelevant to their play in the premier league and champions league to me though. ",dyg2hdd
realmadrid,Just sounds like you tried to give me a second chance lol,dyg2h3t
realmadrid,"I think he had a bad game against Juventus in the second leg for sure, compounded by that awful blunder. However, I thought keeping Bayern to 1 goal given how at least the first half played out (I could not watch the second half at work) was huge for the team. That we even equalized before half was indicative of the grit the whole team showed after going down a goal.

This last game was different. He had some incredible saves, was involved in the cluster fuck first Bayern goal (though just as at fault was the defending), and thought James' goal was just good finishing. The only game out of the last 3 that he was truly bad in was Juventus, but to be fair that could have cost us advancing so it's a legitimate gripe.

I think at least in the league Navas has been exposed by his own defense numerous times. ",dyg2eb7
realmadrid,"So why does Jesus start over him in Brazil? I lived in Rio for a year, experienced the World Cup and then spent a few summers there until the olympics(so 2016) and no one I knew thought firmino was a big deal. Idk they probably do now.

realmadrid,"That midfield 4 was so glorious when in possession but it wasn't strong enough on defense. Kovacic's defensive positioning was awful at times and Kroos didn't even bother to defend. I hope Zidane finds a way to play the same midfield with Casemiro in for Asensio. Casemiro is not very good in possession but he is absolutely needed when the other team has the ball.

If Zidane could organize the team in a 4-4-2 when defending and a 3-5-2 when attacking (Casemiro staying back with Ramos and Varane to allow Marcelo and Carvajal to push further up and provide the width) then we a midfield 4 of Kovacic, Kroos, Casemiro, and Modric could work.

Defensive formation:

    Navas

    Carvajal - Varane - Ramos - Marcelo

    Modric - Casemiro - Kovacic - Kroos

    Benzema - Ronaldo

Offensive formation:

    Navas

    Varane - Casemiro - Ramos

    Modric - Kovacic - Kroos

    Carvajal - Benzema - Ronaldo - Marcelo

Transitioning between the offensive and defensive formations is probably gonna take a lot of training and understanding between players to pull it off successfully. I don't think we have enough time to do it this season but could be an option for next season",dyft7cu

I think Navas is great, not the best goalkeeper, but he does give his all to us. He may not be the best, but his heart gives his all. The thing this season he really made mistakes at crucial times in the CL, but lucky he then goes Super Sayian on us the next week and save our butt, we then forget. ",dyfsonz
realmadrid,"Imagine if Real Madrid is currently the winner on the website.
The world would explode",dyfryoy
realmadrid,SALAH could have put us to bed that tie if his finishing wasn't so bad. We are going to need our defensive A game against pool,dyfrvkf
realmadrid,Beast!,dyfrohp
realmadrid,"Probably not. 4 Champion's League Finals and a genuine appreciation from the Madrid faithful go a long way in the consideration of a players career. It would in mine. 
I think he stays and battles it out. He's started before, so why not again.

At least one more year",dyfrmty
realmadrid,"Sure Barcelona fake fans are bad, but can you imagine the English if Liverpool win? 

""Our league's third place team toppled the Real Madrid""

""Further proof the Premier League is the most competitive"" ... Blah blah

*Don't pay attention to the fact Madrid is also in third. Keep going.*",dyfrgtn
realmadrid,We need stadium sound / crowd reaction videos to get more popular. Clip was amazing but that music really killed the hype.,dyfrgbg
realmadrid,"Ramos is like, Yeah you're a great striker, but I don't give a fuck about it.",dyfrerl
realmadrid,"This is Real Madrid.  So good it has hater's spending time to hate us.  
The price of success",dyfrdxl
realmadrid,Think Casemiro will push for a move if he doesn't get the playing time?,dyfr7zj
realmadrid,"This is nowhere near Tiki Taka in terms of technique and passing, and I dont want us to play that boring passing football with people that are more dominant in a counter than short passes.",dyfr4i0
realmadrid,"He has. I think it will be Kova starting, too. Just based on his possession and speed attributes, which aren't necessarily Casemiro's strong points. ",dyfr22b
realmadrid,"This is the LION talking about his experience. 
Vamos Ramos.",dyfqxch
realmadrid,"In hindsight, not such a great prediction eh",dyfqx7p
realmadrid,"For me the biggest part is cosistency,I feel he looses his focus way to often. Personally I think when he is focused he is top 3 in the world, but he has a focus issue sometimes i.e Juventus' third goal... we need someone who is ""on"" all the time, maybe just bring up Luca Zidane and let Keylor only keep in the big matches instead of splurging money, he has been really promising :)",dyfqwf1
realmadrid,"Now, I'm worried",dyfqocv
realmadrid,Idk man casemiro is pretty slow. I could see ZZ start kova to follow firminio around,dyfqlz4
realmadrid,"Modric had a rough year in 2014-2015 after he cut his hair. He promptly returned to brilliance upon restoring its majesty.

Navas cut his hair, and had a great game. He was still effective for us before, but now he's effective AND has a better haircut.

Now if only Bale would rediscover his 2013-2014 hairstyle...",dyfqlue
realmadrid,"Tony is without one of the best, but boy he has a remarkable weakness... he does not run.",dyfqkaj
realmadrid,4 out of top 5 goal scorers in the CL are all Real Madrid players and our current frontline has two of the top 5,dyfqijq
realmadrid,"I agree. 80% of the passing was within the back line. Not criticizing the end result, but I don't think it's hard to distinguish a good bit of possession from an inordinate series of brilliance. ",dyfqgmd
realmadrid,Ramos is the hardest defender to face in a 1-v-1 or when counter attacking,dyfqgc2
realmadrid,"I've been watching Rusev since literally NXT and I never put that together. Wow.

Happy Rusev day!",dyfqf4f
realmadrid,"Hasn't Kovacic played in a holding role before? I recall him mostly collecting the ball and moving up field, which wouldn't necessarily mesh with the holding role, but I feel like he's done it before.",dyfq3wq
realmadrid,"Insane how we switched the play to the opposite flank so effortlessly and so quickly at least 3 times in this play, imagine how tough it is to defend against this team!",dyfpnx1
realmadrid,"One of the reasons Ronaldo was so quiet during the semis is because not only did Bayern do a great job to cut off his supply, they guarded him well also.

That being said, I don't think Liverpool's defense can handle that the way Bayern did. Hopefully we can see Ronaldo shine, as well as others. I'd love a goal a piece by the BBC. ",dyfozuw
realmadrid,Assuming they are fit bale or is co should start before asensio and asensio and vazquez should come on as super subs to kill the game ,dyfokju
realmadrid,Thanks dude!!,dyfokfk
realmadrid,"navas already down when james went for the ball because it was deflected. He went straight at james after he get back on his feet but that wasnt enough. He is fast. And navas is an offensive goalkeeper which relies more on his speed and athleticism while de gea is defensive one which relies more on his position and skills. Navas suits madrid style very well. How often did u see de gea leaving his line during set pieces? Or leaving his box to clear the ball? 

And no. I always watch epl match because it fell right at night time here. Not only recently but always. I said sometimes de gea stumbled. Not moving and just ball watching the ball because he cant react to that. And he always have his feets wide open which make it hard for him to make a reflex saves whenever he face a sudden shot or deflected balls. And he stumbled. Just like that. Go and watch. I still rate ddg higher. But navas reflexes is still miles ahead of him. ",dyfoavk
realmadrid,"im sorry but the title is wrong. raul madrid hangs with no one, everybody else hangs out with his majesty",dyfoad0
realmadrid,Haha.. So good,dyfoa56
realmadrid,Yes.,dyfo2ej
realmadrid,Did Ramos do a Nainggolan tackle halfway through the video?,dyfo03g
realmadrid,"Something along the lines of ""If Barcelona want a guard of honour, they can have it with our European Cup and Champions League trophies""",dyfnz82
realmadrid,Wait I don‚Äôt get it that was just passing around isn‚Äôt that what teams do. How is that tiki taka how is that cruyffism. What,dyfnwkq
realmadrid,"Yes, everything on land was shot with a sony rx100 with the zhuyin crane to stabilize it. Air shot was with the dji mavic pro. I don‚Äôt recommend doing it tho since there‚Äôs sooooo much interference around the Bernab√©u I found myself losing connection every few seconds. I‚Äôm from Venezuela, used to live in Miami and now I‚Äôm just backpacking around the world making videos. That ticket cost 310 euro. They vary depending wether it‚Äôs la liga or champions league. If there‚Äôs a Real Madrid pena i suggest u join it where u live. They can usually get u a ticket in advance. You can also buy one online days before the game. If not then on viagogo but you‚Äôll insane fees. Hala Madrid ",dyfnvme
realmadrid,"What your describing isn't down to reflexes. Goal keepers know their angles, if a keeper is routed to the spot it means he knows if this is on target he can't reach it.

Just because you make an attempt to dive for a shot if you miss it's still a goal. 

If anything what your describing is down to positioning and ambidexterity not reflexes. Navas literally made a mistake in the last game which was down to reflex. He couldn't change his footing position fast enough and got nutmegged by James' shot. ",dyfnfx5
realmadrid,let's show him who the daddy is,dyfnae8
realmadrid,They gotta be fined after full time whistle?,dyfmzjk
realmadrid,Great quote. What a boss.,dyfmziv
realmadrid,If this happened /r/soccer would call it one of the best goals of the season. Only la masia cohesion can produce something this well orchestrated. ,dyfmyap
realmadrid,"did u shoot all the shots? did u use a drone to shoot above the stadium view?

great vid btw. how much does a ticket cost and lastly, where are u from?",dyfmxzs
realmadrid,"Ney, Higu, Lewa=0 goals this season against Ramos n Keylord",dyfmvvx

realmadrid,UEFAlona is paying big money to avoid a Real Madrid's victory.,dyfmm4a
realmadrid,"Lol i watch him too. I love watching football. Go and watch the goals he conceded. How he dont even move an inch. Stumbled. But whenever he made a worldclass saves, split second reflexes u guys made it like it was the end of the world. while navas made that kind of saves in almost every match he play. Even though he made a mistakes often unlike de gea. And conceded because of stupid mistakes. But his reflexes is miles ahead of ddg",dyfmk95
realmadrid,yeah break his leg ,dyfmjot
realmadrid,"Do you regularly see top 15 lists? I can't comment on a lot of the other players, but in the prem he has been one of the 5 best attacking players this season. He is miles shears of morata, laca, Giroud and Lukaku. He is still considerably better then Jesus. Kane and Aguero each have been more consistent for longer, but firmino has been as good as both this season. ",dyfmjhp
realmadrid,"""Madrid pays off uefa every year"" lol",dyfmj3p
realmadrid,"The Kroos/Kovacic midfield duo was never gonna work,but we saw Kovacic and Casemiro absolutely nullify PSG in Paris.Starting Kovacic was a good decision,but starting him with Kroos was not,he should ve started alongside Casemiro. 
Having LV as RB exposed us additionally and we looked more vulnerable as usual.I agree Kova is wasted as CDM,just because he is very good at defending for his age,he should still play further up the pitch.",dyfmg1r
realmadrid,"We need to play Ronaldo, i think benching him or not including him can break his form",dyfmfwg
realmadrid,"Obviously Casemiro will start, barring an injury of course.",dyfmdwh
realmadrid,"I don't think you watch De Gea, he is out of this world",dyfmdef
realmadrid,"I don't think Casemiro can handle Liverpool's pressing.  If zidane yanked him vs Juves press and didn't trust him vs Bayern, I doubt he'll start the final.  ",dyfmde4
realmadrid,"He did ran circles around our defenders in those 2 legs, but his finishing was very poor. Every ball that came towards him he tried to take it on hos left foot. 
Now even tho he is a lethal finisher I still think he avoid to shoot from his right foot.",dyfmdbt
realmadrid,I think Asensio isn't being that effective starting up front. He is a super sub though. May be Bale should start instead of him.,dyfmbgj
realmadrid,I still can't pin point the fact that people have Madrid. Why on Earth....,dyfmatl
realmadrid,Same goes to navas cat like reflexes. And everytime DDG stumbled..not even moving when he conceded a goal. I can always relate it to navas. Navas almost never stumbled like that. He always have a move for any balls came in. Although sometimes he conceded a goals because of his reach etc. And i still prefer navas over ddg because of his athleticism. ,dyfmai9
realmadrid,"Ronaldo,Modric,Marcelo,Isco,Ramos,James(technically still on loan) 
There you go,buddy!now be a good boy and fuck off if you don't even know our own squad",dyfm4bu
realmadrid,"Dude, people are calling their front 3 overrated because they have no idea who Firmino and Mane are! Liverpool are so damn lucky to have Klopp, I don‚Äôt see any other manager who can develop those 3 better than him. This current Liverpool is better than the Suarez era imho!",dyfm2rq
realmadrid,I wouldn‚Äôt say Navas is better. De Gea singlehandedly kept United from being a mid table team this season and the last. No way they‚Äôd be in CL if he wasn‚Äôt their GK these past years. ,dyfm1vp
realmadrid,I‚Äôm with you. We should go full squad on those Cules. It‚Äôs not like the final is next week. ,dyfm1dc
realmadrid,"His reflexes aren't better than De Gea, de Geas reflexes and saving with his feet are literally his trademark attributes. ",dyfm0w2
realmadrid,jesus christ the music is god awful ,dyflzgr
realmadrid,I don‚Äôt care if he did extend his contract. FIRMINO. ,dyflzb4
realmadrid,He‚Äôs changed a good amount but I‚Äôm certain that Ramos can still contain him,dyflyg5
realmadrid,Yeah you're right,dyflti2
realmadrid,"It's not about going missing. He was pressing at the wrong time and creating loop holes for Bayern to exploit time and again. It basically fucks up any structure we have. In the match thread, plenty of people pointed to that. Loads of time, players would go past him with ease and face our back four. As an experienced player, he should know better than that. Also offensively, there are good number of times he gave away with no pressure on him, which is something we can't afford to do against Bayern. And then to top it off, that last min, where Bayern were piling the pressure and he went on the ground at the slightest of touches multiple times and that would distract the team as well as Bayern would continue with the play whilst Kroos is trying to get the ref's attention pointlessly. That was against mentioned in the thread. He's been underwhelming the last few games more or less and on form and against a record scoring side like Liverpool , I would personally take no chances with our defense. Liverpool take most of their chances.",dyflpnp
realmadrid,What happened on Bernabeu against Bayern was we had to run a lot chasing the ball and in attacking too. And Toni is a player who doesn't run much. That's why he was seen nowhere in the pitch. Just my opinion. Correct me if I'm wrong.,dyfla3e
realmadrid,"Well deserved!

He was fucking immense for us, made some great saves.

Thank God he cut his hair, we have out Keylord back again! ",dyfl9c4

realmadrid,"Apologize for interrupting, I was curiously lurking ahead of the final. How come we are cock? Do you seriously rate a whole group of fanbase based on a few attention seeker on /r/soccer? Well If I was about to do the same and rate Madeid fans based on you man.. you dont wanna know. My childhood bestfriend is an RM fan, therefore I have great respect for the team, but some things you mention dont make much sense. I admit, Porto side was not the strongest, but I honestly believe that Man City side outweights both Juve and PSG in everything or at the most, Id say they are just as good as Juve and Bayern. Rome beat Barcelona 3-0 at home, the Barcelona that trashed RM back in autumn. Yes, they didnt not get a pen, we all know. We didnt get a pen either, Florenzi didnt get a red card (nobody mentions?), They were gifted a pen at Anfield to compensate our 4 goal lead. 


I really didnt mean to offend anyone or interrupt, I was only curious about RM fans opinion. We are not cock, we just.. ""dont fear anyone. respect, yes. fear? no."" and I hope this quote rings a bell! :) ",dyfl691

realmadrid,"i feel zizou is more adamant with his possession football. Look at the line-up the last game, didn't even care to make a change till they scored the 2nd goal. Lucas was basically playing RM half the time. I do hope Casemiro starts and I would even start Kova over Kroos. Kroos has disappointed me in the last few games especially the last one. In the last min of the game, he just dove to the ground three times . Inexcusable for a player of his experience and gave the ball plenty of times as well.",dyfjiq7
realmadrid,Still don‚Äôt want him. ,dyfjhhp

Seriously tho, I think we definitely need to play Casemiro in the final to help try and nullify that front three to the best of our abilities. ",dyfjdva

realmadrid,I understood only two things : Madrid and champions,dyfj4ch
realmadrid,"Lol yeah , Ramos has been playing great players since he was a teenager. I do feel Firmino is a bigger threat and is the player who facilitates Salah to thrive better. The team needs to neutralize Firmino as much as possible.",dyfiyin

realmadrid,Most terrifying comment. Lol at firmino=benzema on steroids ,dyffmga
realmadrid,Love it !,dyffkyw
realmadrid,"Nope, not at all. They receive the hype they deserve. Man√© is a beast, Firmino is a Benzema on steroids and Salah is making perhaps the best season individually of any player non called Messi or Ronaldo since Sneijder in 2010.     
     
Seriously, just look at Firmino. The guy wasn't half of what he is today, but this season even if he has basically no angle he will somehow find space and shoot, just look at his shots against Roma.    
     
Salah is easily a one man army, similar to peak Ronaldo. While he excels when Firmino plays for him, he's not afraid of coming alone from the flank, make a dribble and shoot out of nowhere.     
         
   
Comparatively speaking they are as a trio, far better than today's BBC in terms of performance. Last thing we need right now is getting comfortable like we've done against Juve and Bayern in the second legs.",dyffhdf

realmadrid,"&gt; If you think Kroos is more press resistant than Modric,I urge you to rewatch last years semi final 2nd leg vs Atletico...While the whole team was shitting bricks,Modric was holding the ball versus 2 or 3 Atletico players all the time and kept us in the tie.

No I wouldn't put it like that. Kroos is his own flavour of press-resistance which is no less effective than Modric. It's probably unfair to both to try and say which is the more resistant. I was trying to say that Kroos needs to be in the 11 otherwise their press will overrun us. Bad form or not, for this alone he needs to play. 

&gt; I think the weakness in our system with Kroos is when we don't have the ball,we can get overrun and Kroos almost never covers for Marcelo like Modric did for Vazquez the other day

Bingo. 
",dyfc3yt
realmadrid,"You're right you can't base everything off history, especially when you have no history like ManC. However if the tables were turned and Real got all the teams that Liverpool did, we'd be hearing ""corruption"". The fact Real beat 3 Champions over 2 legs back to back to back, shows Real are clear favourites. Liverpool have hardly been tested by a single CL giant. ",dyfc2j9
realmadrid,I love the laughing stock Barca has become in Europe the last few years ,dyfc0cc
realmadrid,"Against Bayern starting Kova was bad a choice(no blame to Zidane for that,he tried something new).Kova shouldn't play CDM, that's not where his ability lies.He should play as CAM or CM.Also having LV as RB trobuled a lot.Modric played as RB most of the time,so that he can't dictate the game.So overran our MF,but we had proper RB and Case as CDM Bayern wouldn't had exploited as they did.",dyfbz5g
realmadrid,"They have a good partnership and the understanding between them is good. So many times Benzema holds off defenders for Ronaldo to score (Juve first goal) and Ronaldo does the same for him. They function quite well together. Ronaldo also understands what's it like to be in Benzema's position right now, to be low on confidence. That's why he's always trying to get the crowd on Benz's side. Like you said, he is a leader from within.",dyfbyxk
realmadrid,When has Barcelona purposefully injured a Real Madrid player? Please share a link of video. They're divers not dirty players.,dyfbxj3
realmadrid,You can't base everything off of history. Regardless there's nothing wrong with being cautious. Being flipant towards a team that has progressed all the way to the final of cl is a grave mistake. Football isnt settled on paper.,dyfbwc3

realmadrid,They beat man city,dyfbnqy
realmadrid,They played nobodies. 7-6 doesn't sound convincing.,dyfbkw4
realmadrid,The issue isn‚Äôt with the being 3 weeks away. It has to do with our players being gassed out after Bayern game and resting to avoid any fatigue injuries! ,dyfb48t

realmadrid,"Exactly. And it's not like the thing is going unnoticed or something. They've clearly become closer and it's definitely a great sign. Seeing Ronaldo happy for Benz is so heart warming and shows how healthy the dressing room is behind the scenes. In my opinion, this is one of the greatest achievements of Zizou, it's one thing to win matches with such tactical genius and it's an entirely different thing to be able to manage super stars and keep them all healthy. Fees so good. And it's sad that people don't talk about this much as a quality or an achievement that Zizou did when they discuss about him. ",dyfaswn

realmadrid,"Even though Liverpool's front three will be a very potent threat, and a lot of people are underestimating these 3 (they scored the most goals in the CL in its history), the individual lack of quality in their defence, lack of experience and their routine loss of concentration in the last 10-20 minutes will surely be capitalized by Real Madrid.

I have watched almost all of their games this season. The key strategy is to play deep, man mark Firmino, play a lot of long balls to wide areas or especially to the striker occupying Lovren. You all should target the areas between Lovren and Arnold. Their positional sense is woeful and they lose concentration easily. Lovren simply cannot deal with long balls and his anticipation to these balls is really poor. You can also leave men back to prevent a counterattack in the wide areas if you are leading (which is obvious) but honestly I don't even think you would have to do this. These all would completely nullify their attack which is the strongest (and only) force they have. Mourinho did it and Liverpool didn't even have a shot on target. 

They will start at a frantic pace, high tempo, with high pressing and very physical in the beginning. I think Real Madrid's experience will help here as I don't think they have come up against a team as equipped to deal with this. You should play it slow and possession based since you're press resistant and save your energy. The smartest thing is then go gung-ho at 70 minutes and onward as they always collapse around this time. Also, their squad is bare. If they get any injuries again, their subs are utterly woeful (seriously, their backup striker is Ings and Solanke, they have no more central midfielders to play literally.) If Real Madrid go into the break drawn or even leading, you will win for sure. 

Real Madrid have so many options to win here, I can see a big margin, maybe 4-1 or 5-2 with 2 goals coming in the last 10 minutes.",dyfac6v

realmadrid,"I totally agree with you. Liverpool this year is tremendously dangerous with their front 3 and the Full Backs. The player I‚Äôm concerned most is Firmino. He‚Äôs like 2/3 the prime Benzema of 2014. He runs, scores, defends and creates space for teammates.",dyf9teg
realmadrid,I also follow and like Arsenal in EPL. And they got a golden Premier league cup for the invincible season which is something no other PL team have. And it really is a prestigious thing to have imo. Will that be something that would happen in La Liga as well for Barca's uneaten run? Just curious to know.,dyf9p4s
realmadrid,Damn son,dyf9oo0
realmadrid,"It's not an issue with pressing. They showed they can press for 90 minutes but the problem is that they lose concentration as they tire, especially evident in specific players. Their problems are individual due to a lack of quality in players especially Lovren, Arnold, Moreno etc as they tire.

",dyf9imc
realmadrid,"Since it's a free talk thread, I wanted to share that it really felt so happy (something more like oddly satisfying) seeing at the way Ronaldo celebrated with Big Benz after the second leg vs Bayern. I mean, as soon as the final whistle was blown, I noticed Benzema running into the pitch directly towards Ronaldo and hugged him like they both are brothers. And the way Ronaldo embraced him felt so heart warming. I know their emotions are at the peak in those moments but that's something I felt so good about Ronaldo and the entire team as a whole as to how happy they are in the dressing room something like an extended family. Any thoughts about my point? I know Ronaldo moves a little more close with Marcelo but it looks like he became more close to Benz and Bale of late than how they were before. I mean, the penalty incident also proves the point. This also shows how much of a leader he is from with in. Feel free to discuss more. Ignore if you feel the topic as nonsense. I just wanted to share this with you. Thanks for the opportunity! Hala Madrid.. Vamos. On to the finals and after! ",dyf9htk

realmadrid,"I haven't downvoted, I never do. But reasons as to why you are football illiterate has nothing to do with you not knowing who Mane is. Or well it ties in to it. For one, if you do now know who Mane is, you probably never watched Liverpool play, which makes me wonder how you possibly can say that Firmino is not a top 25 forward? Did you look at his stats and decided he sucks?

Secondly just because there is memes about benzema does not mean he sucks, how old are you? 

Thirdly, say whatever you want about benz but he deserves the respect that our legends of previous era got. Yes he has not been his best the past year, but anyone watching games can see the value he brings to the games.

Somehow I do understand why you don't see the value in Benz, he is cut from the same cloth as Firmino, a selfless striker who does only whats best for the team, A W for him is more satisfying than a hat trick with a Lose. 
",dyezcym

Well you forced me to elaborate. I have watched benz for the last 9 years and could go on all day about his work rate, his turnovers, his at times extremely inaccurate passing, dribbling or shooting. There are reasons as to why he starts for real and his skill is not it. I have several friends in Madrid who have season passes to Bernab√©u and every single one fully agrees with me. We constantly make fun of how bad he is. But sure call bs on me and downvote me. ",dyeyq0y

realmadrid,"As a Madrid fan who's been following Liverpool for a while, I think you must be either deluded or too arrogant if you think they're overhyped! It's true that they were shite when Suarez left them and get replaced by Ballotelli, but Klopp's made this team very entertaining and threatening at the same time! 

Sadio was their best player last season, but he still performs very well such as the 2nd Roma game despite ""allegedly being overshadowed by Mohamed  Salah"". Firmino wasn't scoring as much last season, but this season we wish Benzema was performing as well as him. They have a similar role in the teams, but Firmino has much greater defensive work rate. I am happy that Big Benz was crucial against Bayern, but his season is still rather overwhelming! There is no explanation for Salah, he is just so gooooood! 

Overall, you gotta give it to Klopp! I just can't hate the dude and I found myself rooting for them in the EPL! This Liverpool is arguably even better since Coutinho left the team! Anything can happen in this sport, but those three scored and assist plenty this season! I'd argue they are the most lethal opponent we will face on the UCL!

And let's not kid ourselves! This year Ronaldo may be better than last season, but I much prefer the team we had last year! We had better depths, competition, and experience. Luck has also been on our side up to this point. Overall, I think we have better defense and definitely midfield, but we can't underestimate them at all! I think we can definitely win but we gotta get our shit together too! I have so much respect for Liverpool as a team and I can't wait to see the final! It's going to be hell of a match!",dyexvmy

realmadrid,"Observed that for this game, where Salah will be playing right wing most likely, it's important that we have someone stable supporting Marcelo so we can roam forward.

realmadrid,"It‚Äôs just because our (LFC) attack is so good and exciting to watch, and we haven‚Äôt seen anything like it for a long time.

But! We don‚Äôt play against defenders like Varane, and the only keeper in football on par with Navas is De Gea - and he shut us down. So yeah, your defense is better than anything we‚Äôve come up against and that makes me nervous. Our keeper situation isn‚Äôt ideal, you clearly have the advantage there, which is really scary.

You have to admit though, that this is a tasty, tasty fucking matchup. I‚Äôve watched more Madrid and Liverpool games than any other teams this season - I‚Äôve watched all of them and some multiple times - and this Champions League final is a dream.

So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts.

realmadrid,"Salah is all that - this year. Firmino is good, but not that good (as some people think) and I didn't heard a lot about Mane.

The thing with Salah is that he's having a beastly phase, buy we don't know if he will stick or not - or even if he can sustain that without blowing up his muscles and becoming injury prone. All in all, I think the crazy way Salah moves makes the lives of Firmino and Mane easier because it's not that hard to eff things up and leaving one of them unchecked. I think it's possible to play smart again them - the thing is, you need to press and score a couple goals just in case, which makes playing again Liverpool tricky.

If you consider the whole team, I think Bayern is a lot more dangerous, due to the quality MFs to help the attackers.

IF Benz starts scoring again regularly, we can trash some serious teams, while right now we are just winning things. Imo, Liverpool is the underdog, that's why some people are rooting for them. Since we did the most during away games on the last couple phases, we just have to not get caught offguard while doing our thing. I was more nervous last year, tbh.",dyeosos

realmadrid,"If you are gonna play as CM in a 442 system in 2018,your JOB is to ""get stuck in"".And seriously,what kind of bullshit talk is this ""generational talent""?There is atleast 6 or 7 players in the team that are more talented than Kroos and they all work harder.He is not Messi level so he can afford to cover 6km per game. 
I don't know where you get your stats from,but according to whoscored,Modric made more tackles and dispossed the enemy team 4 times compared to Kroos' 0.The average distance covered means absolutely nothing,Kroos has 1 pace and that's slow.Notice that for the first goal of Bayern yesteday and last week,he is casually jogging back while the others around him are sprinting back to cover. 
Offensively Modric was limited to being played on the right side,but he still linked up way better with the team,maybe go back and read the Match/post match thread where it was general consensus that Modric was our best outfield player.",dyejwdz
realmadrid,"Well recently as in last summer, relatively new to popularity ",dyejngj

realmadrid,When you say you just heard of Mane do you mean like literally this CL campaign? He was massive last year as well,dyeivho
realmadrid,"Yes, they are! The front three is lethal but not equal to the hype they're receiving; I compare this match to the Monaco vs Juventus match last season; Monaco was the best attacking side last season with Mbappe on fire, scoring over 150 goals, but when they met Juve, experience and pure grit won over naivety exuberance...that's exactly what will play out in the finals, they'll even have a worse fate than Monaco",dyeijtl
realmadrid,Agent Raul reporting in. ,dyehx4f
realmadrid,"I‚Äôm sure plenty of Germans are happy Madrid knocked Bayern out.   Plenty of Italians happy that Madrid knocked Giuve out too.  And Roma fans are a little salty after that scandalous ref denied two clear penalties and allowed a  Liverpool goal off a clear push on Dzeko.

",dyehpzb
realmadrid,"Their national team is the worst, yet according to themselves a threat to the cup each WC. I think Liverpool are a good team that have done well to avoid any of the perenial UCL powerhouses. Man City was a good win though. ",dyehiox
realmadrid,"It is not his job to ""get stuck in"" though. It is not why he is a generational talent. It is not how you use a player of such ability. 

BTW, Kroos and Modric both had the exact SAME  number of ball recoveries **\(7\)** last night. So, this ""Kroos pulls out of challenges"" thing doesn't really make much sense. 

Moreover, stats show that Kroos covers on average the second most distance after Carvajal in the Champions League. And is often the first one to take the initiative to press. 

And again, Modric, offensively didn't have any better impact than Kroos did. When we had the ball, Kroos was the one switching the play, helping us escape the press and create overloads like he always does. 

It is not always the player at fault. They need to be put in the right role, with the right structure in order to perform well. ",dyehfbx

Mourinho put the chokehold on Klopp, he was mouth-breathing through the post match interviews.  They‚Äôre a fucking overrated team - they‚Äôve lost 5:0 to City in the league, 4:1 to Spurs, to us, they‚Äôll probably lose to Chelsea on Sunday.   

Roma were so stupid tactically at Anfield, and Pep also went gung-ho and got obliterated.

realmadrid,"If you think Kroos is more press resistant than Modric,I urge you to rewatch last years semi final 2nd leg vs Atletico...While the whole team was shitting bricks,Modric was holding the ball versus 2 or 3 Atletico players all the time and kept us in the tie.  
I think the weakness in our system with Kroos is when we don't have the ball,we can get overrun and Kroos almost never covers for Marcelo like Modric did for Vazquez the other day.I agree with you that whoever plays as the cental DM (Kova/Case) will have to help the left side a lot more than usual",dyegn3n
realmadrid,"I hope all purchases are made before the WC, prices are inflated now and will be even more after the WC. I think it's obvious which areas of the pitch need to be improved and we could get the players early so that they get a full pre-season as well. ",dyeglo6

realmadrid,"It's a PR stunt in the end, but I can't stop the feeling of thinking that this whole exclusion from the French national team has caused his big drop in form over the past two years. The longer this national team issues continue, the longer he will be like this. As a side note, France has one of the best squads in the world right now, but Deschamps is a truly bad coach. If they are terrible at the WC, he could get sacked and the next manager may want to bring Karim back. ",dyega0a
realmadrid,"Little issues with the effort? Watch the game again,Kroos pulled out of every single challenge he could while Modric went into every single challenge and fought like a madman.It was Modric who also played out of position and had a much greater impact to the game",dyefwkh
realmadrid,The brightest aspect of this weekend's matchup is it's certainly not at the Bernabeu,dyefuxq
realmadrid,He seeks the excellency when driving.,dyefb92
realmadrid,"You are completely disregarding the formation played, the tactics and the opposition. 

Kroos and Modric were the ones pressing the CBs most consistently, along with Lucas and Benz. 

If Bayern by\-passes that press, the issue is with the pressing structure or the effort being put by the players involved in pressing. 

Yesterday, there was little issue with the effort of the players but a lot of issues with the actual defensive structure and the pressing structure. Because Bayern kept by\-passing the midfield as if it wasn't there. 

Modric might have seemed great because he ran a lot, but that doesn't mean he was very effective or imposing. He wasn't because Zidane's tactics and approach didn't allow him to be. 

Therefore, it is rather naive to ignore these things and conclude that Kroos  was terrible. 

Lastly, it is important to play to the strengths of the players you have, rather than want players who run a lot. ",dyeetfu
realmadrid,"Firmino is an alright but not even top 20. Salah is only good if you give him a lot of space. Neymar-Cavani, mandzukic-dybala or Bayern in general were more dangerous imo ",dyeej1s
realmadrid,"As much as I want to see Liverpool destroyed, crying and walking alone without a trophy, there's a final that needs to be played. Our team does have top drawer quality players and anything can happen in 90 mins. Although I do agree with what Benzema said.

Don Gato: ""We dont play finals, we win them.""

If they go with this mentality, then nothing can stop us.

What also makes them threatening is that their league is already wrapped up when we get to the later stages of the CL which means that they can *really* throw everything in the games, like making injections to injured players like they did this season.

IMO Man Utd is not extremely threatening. I've yet to see Lukaku play a great game against good opposition, and IMO all their wingers and fullbacks are barely average except for Martial. Their midfield and central defense are good because of their physicality but with European refs they won't get away with really hard tackles and one red card in a knock out round means it's probably over.

PSG have got all the players to be a great force in Europe but IMO they lack the mental element that could make them a truly great team.",dm6bbwz

Two days after his kidnapping, he was released with not a scratch on him, and had to face the press.

Which is not an exciting task after being held against ones will.

''The commander of the rebel group, Maximo Canales, directed the kidnapping and was with me all the time. He apologized a thousand times for the inconvenience. I was worried because of the anguish it was causing my wife and my eight-year-old son.

realmadrid,"What is the projected starting 11?

              Benz Bale
                 Isco   
    Kroos Llorente Modric
Marcelo Casemiro Nacho Carvajal

Is there a chance Zizou doesn't go with a DM and play Kovacic (if healthy) or Ceballos? ",dm5e0fk
realmadrid,"I think our best chance was last year tbh. We had by far the best squad depth in Europe, but we've lost important players from the bench. We can say that we've got new young players and it's true, most if not all of them will be great players in just a few years, but we can't yet compare Ceballos to James, he isn't at that level yet. We also can't really consider Llorente and Vallejo in big games, not yet at least. This is where Pepe would have been great. Take the Valencia game from tomorrow, Ramos and Varane are out, why couldn't we have kept Pepe? We also lost Morata, and we haven't gotten any new signing up front. He scored more goals than Benzema last season, playing a lot less and being arguably the best player of our ""B-Team"" from last season. I think we had the best squad depth probably ever, and even with injury problems we tackled everything fine. We missed Bale for months, yet it had little to no impact on the team. 

Even if our new signings are great, and in the long run may prove to be amazing, right now, this season, I don't think we'll be as good as last one.

realmadrid,"Ty, man. ",dm4ou19
realmadrid,"Asensio is very talented. Like I said, he'll probably reach double-double in goals and assists in the future. Kinda like Hazard in Chelsea, Neymar in Bar√ßa(now PSG), Robben in Bayern etc. But notice the trend; are any of the players I mentioned ""main goalscorers""? No. You got Costa(now Morata) in Chelsea, Suarez in Bar√ßa, Cavani in PSG, Lewa in Bayern etc. 

These are star players that can work with main target mans and strikers. That's how they maintain their goalscorer-playmaker role. 

But the problem is, Ronaldo and Messi set a wrong example. These guys are not human. They don't play as main strikers or playmakers and still score more goals than their striker partners and assist more than playmakers in their team.

We watch these two and expect Asensio to score and assist like Ronaldo. That's very hard, even impossible. Ronaldo constantly evolved his game, I wrote about it elsewhere. He's not natural striker, but he plays like one. He's natural winger, but doesn't play like that anymore. Benzema is the striker, but in matches he switches role with Ronaldo. Similar with Messi. He's just a beast that scores goals and makes assists with ease.

With Asensio, we should develop a Hazard like playmaker/winger. That would be very ideal after Ronaldo leaves us. Then we should find a good, young, clinical striker outfront that can form a partnership with Asensio in two forward 4-4-2 formation or 4-3-3 with Asensio as LW, a RW and our main striker upfront.

This doesn't mean Asensio won't score 25-30 goals. If he is able to fill in Ronaldo's shoes and scores huge chunks of goals, nobody holds him back. But his main role should be Hazard type inside forward/playmaker type winger. That will ensure a constant good performance from Asensio without depending on him for scoring goals. But the main goalscorer should be someone else. 

Otherwise, Asensio as main striker would limit his potential and talent. Just like players like Hazard, Robben, Neymar etc. always prefer to play alongside a striker, rather than being the main guy upfront. That's my opinion.",dm4o7db

realmadrid,"That's why I said *maybe*. It's really a testament to what Real have built and how Zidane has managed that the best/2nd best player in the world is practically not needed at all. It's beautiful work.

But Ronaldo's presence on the team alone brings fans to watch more Real games, buy more Real merchandise, and be Real fans even if they won't be when he retires. His status, much like Messi's for Barcelona, make Real a bigger club. 

This cannot be said-- not even close-- about Mbappe who no one even knew a year ago. ",dm4lu70

realmadrid,I agree,dm4j359
realmadrid,"I agree that they're stronger, but not because of Dembele and Coutinho. But rather Paulinho and Semedo.

Wait, hear me out. The issues Barcelona face right now are not going forward but keeping the front lines supplied. Notice how Messi is constantly dropping super deep to get the ball to bring it forward. This makes it much easier for opposing teams to guard Suarez up front because nobody else is a problem up there. This also means there's more room to guard Messi, it forces him to have to cover way more of the pitch to be a threat.

This is where Paulinho and Semedo come in. Barcelona knows they need to adapt to a new philosophy because the current one requires such a specific calibre of player and a very specific set of skills. These types of players are hard to find and the ones that are available often only fit into one of those 2 requirements rather than both. The ones that do fit into both are already here at Madrid, or at Bayern or PSG. So, the next best thing is to change how you play. Paulinho adds in that verticality to connect the midfield to the attack. He can bring the ball up and make deep runs. Is he the best player for this? Probably not. But he's probably pretty good at it. They need to address immediate needs first, and then focus on the future.",dm4irxa

realmadrid,"It isn't about having a star though, you need a prolific, clinicial goal scorer. Asensio can play as LW or CAM, can score goals and provide assists, but he will not become our main goalscorer. And if you play him and Dybala upfront, you will have two ""second strikers"" out there that won't agree with each other. We will need a target man style striker. Then you can put a playmaker like Dybala next to him. Like his partnership with Higuain in Juve.",dm4g7iu

Now Man Utd and Bar√ßa (for now at least) make more money than us while PSG seem to have found a way to spend infinite money without FFP problems and I guess City will try to exploit that loophole too, we soon won't be able to compete financially which is why we changed our transfer strategy.

I don't doubt that we will eventually find a new striker that will make a great strikeforce with Asensio but I'm kind of disappointed because Mbapp√© coming to us was going to be great, an 18 year old fan of the club that comes to play with his idol Ronaldo and for Zidane and that can stay with us for 15 years and have a great rivalry with Dembel√©. It sounded perfect, but I guess it was too perfect to be true.",dm4cqbh

realmadrid,They haven't been awful against us tho,dm49wmy
realmadrid,"Well the timing could have been perfect IMO. He could have confirmed his potential by achieving a whole season while being the main guy at Monaco, could have become France's main striker for the world cup (it's currently Giroud so it wouldn't be that hard) then made his big Galactico transfer to the biggest club in the world where he would be expected to compete with a 30 year old compatriot.

Now he'll go to PSG with massive pressure on his shoulders because  a lot of people expect him to fail, and he will probably be a starter, but on the right wing where he never played for Monaco AFAIK, and where he'll become a laughing stock if he doesn't score 5 goals a month because a lot of people in France hate PSG.

And yeah I guess he could run down his contract but if he becomes one of PSG's main assets I don't see how they would let it happen, it really doesn't happen that often that big players run down their contracts and in 5 years Ronaldo and Benz will probably be gone and replaced anyway.",dm49sgo

I argued elsewhere that Klopp could be perfect for us after his Dortmund career because his football philosophy can be compatible with Real Madrid: fast attacks, direct passes, high press etc. He went to Liverpool instead and had to build a counter attacking/high pressing team mentality from scratch. Instead if he came here, the success would be instant because team and players were already sharing his philosophy. Oh well, I'm happy Zidane turns out to be perfect for us.

Yeah, in summary the direct and fast play style Klopp left at Dortmund is our kryptonite and both teams with shared football mentality neutralize each other. It ends up with very weird results and very unpredictable matches.

Also, there were different refs for both legs and obviously not all refs are biased or paid but since the first leg was at Camp Nou there was a big chance that the ref would give Barca the advantage. In the 2nd leg, the ref was a bit more fair given that it was played at the Bernabeu. ",dm3wwzt
realmadrid,"Completely agree with you. He's been amazing, he bleeds white and gets along great with the other members. Why in the world would we need De Gea for? It's for fans like these we had such a terrible time in the Galactico era - no patience in players, youth or managers.",dm3wwhx
realmadrid,"Look up the stats about red cards and penalties comparing barcelona, madrid and other Spanish teams since 2004.
 
And you will see it's not a single game. 

In this Twitter you can find this type of stats: https://twitter.com/MaketoLari/status/897116199523373057",dm3wsr2
realmadrid,Weird that he did this against Sporting.,dm3wqpa
realmadrid,The timing was wrong it was just not meant to be. But he can always rundown his contract if he wants to come. Lewandoski knew were he wanted to go and got there even if his club would not sell him,dm3wbg0
realmadrid,"The Mbappe and Dembele situation makes me appreciate Asensio even more.

He never complains, keeps his head down and when given minutes he makes the most of it.

The same applies to Kovacic, he is a great player and would be a starter on most teams but he is patient because he knows that he is learning from the best and that he is a future starter.

Players like Dembele and Mbappe are honestly in it for the money and not for improvement in their football for future success.

Dortmund and Monaco are great clubs for further development and would have given them a large salary as well.

If Mbappe wanted to play for Real he would have still received a lot of money and would be on the best team in the world but clearly he was greedy.

PSG is also a disgrace of a football club rn as well, I hope the go out in the quarter finals of the CL.

Also Hala Madrid and I hope we win the sextuple after all. VAMOS!!!",dm3w60z
realmadrid,"I still don't understand where is this ""fan of Real Madrid"" coming from. Ronaldo posters are Ronaldo posters, he got a tour of Chelsea's facilities too and not just Madrid. Plus, he's a Paris boy if I remember correctly. Yeah, he might be a big Zizou admirer (like every good french boy) but apparently that's not enough.",dm3vytf
realmadrid,"Exactly how I'd analyze it too. I always perceived Dortmund as a stinging bee, and when they play against RMA it's just the same style of play on both sides. I always expect a bunch of bees stinging each other when we clash with them and therefore that explains the abundance of goals and weird draws/losses to them.",dm3vdxa
realmadrid,"Yeah, decent player, score a few goals, kinda liked him considering his status.

Chicharito was the better deal though, i'm still sad he left us, loved the guy and watching him play even though you could argue he wasn't RM quality.

",dm3ux6g
realmadrid,"They got a (big) advantage from two decisions.

Okay the penalty was bullshit but Barcelona get penalties from dives with every ref in Spain or in the CL. I don't think we can assume that they paid off all of them, so I don't know, maybe Bar√ßa spend their training sessions perfecting their diving technique or something.

The other decision comes from the fact that apparently the federation decided to toughen their stance on dives and they know give out yellows like candy when they see it happen. In theory that would be great, but since the refs are too thick to realize that it can be not a foul AND not a dive they'll be giving a lot of yellows to attackers.

So sure those two decisions were wrong, but if I was a ref and someone paid me off I wouldn't give the team a pen, that's too obvious, I'd give fouls to every single touch on their players, and advantage them in every single small call. For example I think that one of the counter attacks we scored came from someone who tackled Messi, if the refs blows the whistle there there's no goal.

I didn't see that in that game or in the return leg so IMO the ref was incompetent but not corrupt.",dm3uv0c
realmadrid,"The players aren't weak, just mediocre.if you pay 60+ for a mediocre player it doesn't make him better. Psg is only doing this.

And yes, if you compare them to toulouse's or metz's players, they are gods. If you compare them to madrid players, they are 2 tiers down, doubt any will be even substitutes. We talk about what they are doing against actual teams good defenders and decent team play. In all these comparisons they suck badly, as the dude above me just described. ",dm3uu4b
realmadrid,"Typical Mourinho sort of player. He did alright considering how long he was here, but at the end of the day he wasn't the real deal.",dm3utvf
realmadrid,"An agent is a player's employee. He's like an advisor, the decision cannot be taken by him. 

If he can influence the player then the player doesn't have a spine. 

If he was truly a Madrid fan he would have signed, that's clear. 

And really now, 6-8mil and he wants 12, at the age of 18..you little neymar, you. 

If, as a football player, you want to evolve, the worst place to do so is at psg. Ok, you ll win some ligue 1 titles which mean nothing and some french cups that mean shit. And you'll suck in ucl, just like man shitty. 

I wonder, if he receives an offer of, let's say 35/year from china, will he go? 

My Madrid doesn't include people like this. My Madrid only includes people with character, that don't get mind blown by arab money. My Madrid doesn't contain psg's camels. 

Tl;dl: his character sucks, oil is running through his veins and he has a dollar sign instead of eyeballs. Thank you, but no thank you. Go ride your camels and watch the ucl semi finals in paris, with the rest of the camel loving colleagues/arab hand kissers, in front of a tv. ",dm3ujlr
realmadrid,Kroos is that quiet kid in class that has straight A's. He's talked about a lot but no one cares to acknowledge him. ,dm3ue65
realmadrid,First leg of the Super Copa we saw a team clearly advantaged.,dm3u7qh
realmadrid,"I'm happy we aren't paying crazy money for this kid. He's a one season wonder are this point. We don't exactly have a lot of room in the team to develop him. I'd rather we focus on developing Asensio. There will always be future mbappes that we can pick up down the road. 

Unless PSG sells some players, I don't even see this deal going down. ",dm3u5xm
realmadrid,"I just saw, thank god.",dm3u3xo
realmadrid,"I think we'll definitely win the Liga, Atleti might have a tough time in their new stadium and they don't have new reinforcements, while Barcelona's midfield is terrible and Dembel√© isn't Neymar.

In the Champions League I see Bayern as our main rival, they are troubled by defensive teams so hopefully they get knocked out by Atleti or Juve, otherwise I think that the tie might depend on how their wingers are doing (they're getting really old so they might decline fast and their replacements aren't really good).

How we do in the Copa depends entirely on the players' fitness after the winter break, last season they all got injured at the same time and those who played didn't look well. Plus Danilo massively fucked up in those Celta games.",dm3u2e8
realmadrid,Until we see a team clearly advantaged I think we are only witnessing refs being incompetent and the federation not willing to admit that their refs fucked up,dm3tod8
realmadrid,The problem is that by going to PSG he'll be stuck there forever if he achieves even half of his potential. And we might not desperately need him right now but we do need a second striker and someone to slowly replace Ronaldo's output to be ready when he retires.,dm3tk1e
realmadrid,Haha Casemigoal! ,dm3sogt
realmadrid,"Of course we can, but a lot of variables is determining the outcome.

Players performing and keep being fit
No major injury crisis

realmadrid,"

Varane trained today. I am sure he will be fit for the game. Pretty confident that Varane and Nacho can handle it. And it we play with 4 midfielders, we won't let Valencia dictate the game ;)",dm3sjkp

realmadrid,"&gt;aurier,

Ah yes the guy who got subbed in and stood still as his man sergi roberto scored the 6-1, yeah you need players like that. And players like Di Maria, who shushes the Camp Nou after his team scored a goal, what a great deal of passion he didn't show when they got behind. Thiago Silva who can't handle the pressure and Rabiot who after one great game (4-0) absolutely chocked in the away game.

*god* we need players like that

and on the other hand a canterano like Vazquez had the balls to ask to take the first pen and Ramos who bleeds white gave us life in the first Cl final.",dm3rn6n
realmadrid,I think Vallejo's ball-playing might surpass ramos in the future. Just not the headers ;),dm3rlh4
realmadrid,"No, players like Ronaldo and Neymar are why clubs wins stuff. Players like Neymar, verratti, draxler, cavani, mbappe, rabiot, aurier, meuiner, marquinhos, areola, trapp, thiago Silva, pastore, di Maria, etc. Obv not all of these are Neymar or Ronaldo but some of them are and many of them are world class and only someone who is a fool or naive really thinks you need someone who bleeds your club to win.",dm3ri7t
realmadrid,Underdogs even,dm3red9
realmadrid,"so what if PSG get stronger?

If they go on like this, they'll never have what clubs like Bar√ßa and Madrid have. Players like Puyol, Ramos, Carvajal, Xavi, Vazquez all players who would give everything for the shirt. And in the end those kind of players are the reason clubs win stuff.",dm3rbsl
realmadrid,"I dunno why but whenever I look at this pic I get the vision of a post-apocalyptic future where one needs to play football in order to survive and this armless 'Terminator Ronaldo' comes to you and says ""Cam wiid me iff yu waant to wiin"" (with a smile)",dm3r8zq
realmadrid,"Really rough for us since it seems that Varane and Vallejo are injured.

",dm3qxsx
realmadrid,Anybody else sense a theme for this season? Let's hope our players take extra care with their tempers and don't give these refs a reason to fuck with us.,dm3qhs8
realmadrid,"It's a shame that we're losing him, but they're offering almost twice what we are and we can't afford to have a 18 year old as the 2nd best paid player in a team full of superstars which just won their 2nd straight CL. Best of luck to him. What we OUGHT TO do is change the rules to further prevent countries from putting 1B in soccer teams every summer.",dm3q3f8
realmadrid,Wtf why was it not revoked? Absurd.,dm3pvjn
realmadrid,"Hmm, now that you've said it... ",dm3p2ef
realmadrid,Wow! I'm such surprised!,dm3ofb3
realmadrid,"Personally I am happy we didn't get him. Honestly I think Mbappe made the right choice not coming to Madrid right now. If he came it would be a bad deal for him and also a bad for Madrid. Mbappe is still young needs as much minutes as possible to quickly achieve his potential and our squad doesn't need him right now. We will buy him when he has finished developing if he still wants to come. I think our squad should focus on developing the young players we currently have, with James and Morata gone the will be even more minutes to give them.

Lets buy players we can currently fit relatively stress free in our squad. Mbappe would have brought too many troubles to the squad IMO",dm3obv5
realmadrid,"I think RM fucked up because now PSG will be much stronger and also they will pay through the roof if/when they eventually try to get him after. 

I hate fans claiming their definition of professionalism is right. Dembele and Mbappe are being professionals by forcing their moves because this is the profession. Clubs toss players around and fans dont care but when players make decisions to do with their business, they are called cunts and completely shamed. These are not tantrums. This is not professionalism. This is forcing a transfer move. This is the business.

Lastly, this is a market. If PSG value Mbappe at 300k a week then RM should pay that if they want and not complain if they're not willing to pay that. 

Anyways, I really hope football fans reconsider my other plea, these players have very little power and in this business they need to do things like sitting out of training or trying to force a move in other way because that is one of the only sources of power they have. ",dm3o72d
realmadrid,"And yet, when they play european match, Getafe would beat them. ",dm3o2hv
realmadrid,"He and Essien did OK. But I thought it looked bad. Madrid shouldn't have to loan players, and Mourinho is obsessed with physical players.",dm3nt43
realmadrid,What a joke,dm3nlhn
realmadrid,"I'm not American and I'd like to have him in Real one day. Also, judging from his potential, it looks like Pulisic is going to become America's best player(probably ever). Whoever have Pulisic will also have a large American fanbase. We can have a talented player like Pulisic and have many additional American fans, overcoming the language barrier. Win-win.

The question is that Dortmund won't be able to hold on to him forever. He'll leave for someone else, but who? We'll see.",dm3nkra
realmadrid,"Why do you have to bring this in? Keylor has been amazing for us year in, year out. ",dm3ni8c

realmadrid,Maybe Casemiro and Theo had a common ancestor. ,dm3lz1o
realmadrid,I'm glad it was short time. Not really our type of player imo. But i surely respect the work he did.,dm3lqet
realmadrid,"I always wonder in these kind of situations how much it is because of agents. I think they don't care if the player plays for us or PSG, but if they get 50k more salary from PSG they surely try to convince player to join that team.

Not sure if it is true in this case though.",dm3lk9j
realmadrid,"That's why we need a second striker, I'm afraid we regret selling Morata.",dm3ljw8
realmadrid,"Look, this player is really talented I like him personally but if he REALLY wanted to join us, he would have accepted the offer we made without negociating the salary.

realmadrid,"They have in the past because they have had breakthrough players and an established coach. Now they're without Reus and (probably) Dembele and maybe even Weigl and are adapting to a new coach. And with out midfield, I think we can easily boss the game. If we stay injury free, this is the most confident I've ever been facing Dortmund.",dm3j2by

I completely agree, we could have got Bayern and Liverpool. Dortmund and Spurs shouldn't be that difficult if we stay injury free",dm3iyi2

realmadrid,Just before they interviewed CR7 they asked Buffon how long he's going to continue playing!,dm3igtg
realmadrid,"Agreed, he is still fairly young for a defender, so I hope he continues to perform and improve.  You're right that this isn't a problem when he partners with Ramos, and I think they complement each other well--I'm always confident with that pairing now if both are fit.  I don't remember him stepping up in terms of leadership when partnered with Varane though, which is why I mentioned it.  Now that we have Casemiro and a more cohesive defensive system under Zidane, that pairing has been proven to work, but none of them really stand out as a leader.",dm3i1op
realmadrid,"On first glance that can also be Casemiro ^ _ ^  
Just saying!",dm3huaj
realmadrid,Those are great points. He does lack the aggressiveness that Ramos brings to the team however I disagree about the leadership aspect. He doesn't need to command the defence because Ramos is doing it. I just have that gut feeling he will excel with us and finally get the praise he deserves. ,dm3hqhd
realmadrid,"Good competition for Benzema.  I remember it sparked some good form from him at a time he was struggling to find his feet.  Glad we didn't keep Adebayor longer though, given how he tended to peter out at his other clubs when not playing for his next contract.",dm3h8xa
realmadrid,"I love Nacho too of course, but he is our backup for a reason.  In terms of consistency, he's pretty far ahead of the others, and you'll very rarely see him making mistakes leading to goals, which is probably the reason you're making this claim (others have pointed out the Vidal goal etc., but I think there are still fewer goals that can be blamed on him than the others).  However, he lacks that little bit of aggressiveness that makes Ramos who he is at his best--not just stopping chances and not committing mistakes, but proactively cutting them out from the start and winning the ball back.  (Ramos also brings leadership to organizing the back line that Nacho doesn't; though he was captain of Castilla and looks comfortable on the field, he doesn't give the impression of managing his defense--Ramos has been the key for this since the departures of Xabi and Iker.)  In this respect Nacho and Varane are quite similar, which explains the flaws in their partnership before Casemiro showed up.  Varane's physical attributes are what make his peak somewhat higher IMO, while Nacho is more versatile.",dm3h52x

I know our current problem lies in striker position but we need to invest in good, young wingers as well. So far we have Ronaldo/Asensio for LW and Bale/Lucas for RW. Vinicius Jr. seems like a guy that can play on both wings, but he'll join our team next year and probably spend some couple of years on loan(unless he proves himself immediately and enter first team at the age of 18). Especially Bale/Lucas side is concerning. 

We're good for now, but we'll need young wingers in the near future(LW seems secured after Asensio, my main concern is RW).",dm35ngd
realmadrid,At roughly 64% of the cost of 1 Neymar,dm35haq
realmadrid,"I think it's because they play very direct and fast. The thing is, over the years we get used to Bar√ßa's possession based, slow-build up, tiki taka style football. Real Madrid had to adapt to that tactic and counter it. So now, we can play very good against teams that are willing to bring ball to our third and pass it there. We can break apart those teams from counters. But Dortmund team always prefer very direct and fast football. They come, they attack quickly and end their turn. That's something we don't get used to and it surprises us. Funny thing is both Dortmund and Real share similar football playing styles, so those two systems kinda clash with each other and results in scores like 2-2, 3-3 etc.

realmadrid,"Really? For 'overall ability, I would put Marcelo &gt; Carlos and legend status Marcelo &lt; Carlos. But I have no doubt in my mind that, in these next 2 years, Marcelo can cement himself as the better LB out of the two. I have enjoyed watching Marcelo much more, though. ",dm2rbr3

Even if a 'top 6' team plays a lower level team, the somehow make it exciting. I'll always love the EPL.   ",dm2qmhu
realmadrid,I will never compare the two. I love them both the same. It is like choosing between my kids. They are both legendary.,dm2qexo

realmadrid,Brutal. Pretty sure GiGi was crying inside.,dm2mboy
realmadrid,"Spurs away can be tricky too. They also have a good squad chemistry, young talented players and a smart coach. The PL fixture can tire them because I think they don't have the squad depth enough to cover week in week out matches. A tired Spurs won't be too much problem, but a fresh first team can give us some trouble. 

But if we keep it cool and don't suffer from critical injuries/suspensions, we can win all of our matches.",dm2mblx

realmadrid,Tough audience ,dm2m7ir
realmadrid,"Let's hope so, I hate those fuckers ",dm2m6jh
realmadrid,I agree but let's not forget that Durtmund ALWAYS plays like a Juve/Barca team against us. ,dm2m5td
realmadrid,I know the current Barcelona at this stage will struggle against Juventus but what about Sporting? This isn't the same Barcelona as before so we shouldn't rule Sporting out right? ,dm2m3d7
realmadrid,It's a Champions League classic now lol. And also they give a pretty good challenge. I actually enjoy Dortmund-Madrid matches.,dm2m35c
realmadrid,Definelty the group of death...for BvB and Tottenham ,dm2m2xs
realmadrid,Yeah but they get a bunch of cash so they're all good ,dm2m1ou

realmadrid,GHAHAHAHAHA. YES. Need a zoom-in on that.,dm2kfdu
realmadrid,"I think we're better placed to deal with BvB this year. 

Tottenham are a wild card as I generally don't rate English clubs too highly: they tend to be physical and aggressive, but Europe is a different animal and UEFA refs offer more protection.

I wouldn't be against us trying to unsettle Dortmund by going after Demb√©l√© or Auba tho.",dm2kdhr
realmadrid,SIUUUUUUU,dm2kdau
realmadrid,"I was expecting worse TBH. 

APOEL will be the punching bag of the group.

Dortmund are always on godmode against us but they have a pretty leaky defence. Last year we might have drawn both games but I thought we were never really in danger and they mostly scored goals that came from our errors (Navas punching the ball back to Aubameyang, leaving Reus alone in the box,...). Overall I think we are better now than we were (especially in the first leg when we were having our ""draw curse"" against yellow teams), while I don't think they have improved and Reus will probably miss both legs.

Tottenham will be tricky, hopefully we play against them away as soon as possible since they aren't used to Wembley.",dm2kcp7
realmadrid,"If this were Spurs at White Hart Lane, then it would be worrying. But it's always great to play an English team imo. 

Dortmund, yet again, will be the difference between finishing first or second in the group.",dm2kc2o
realmadrid,I hope Navas replaces Buffon next year on that list.,dm2kb7f

realmadrid,God pulisic was impressive last year... have to make sure he doesn't lewandowski us,dm2k25a
realmadrid,[Video](https://streamable.com/2mc01),dm2k1s4
realmadrid,"True, we'll see how that alters their play. I thought for sure Liverpool was going to be next after that draw, would've been my luck",dm2k0n5
realmadrid,Not too worried about the group. All we have to do is win at home (which we are used to) and pick up points at APOEL and Wembley. I see Madrid finishing first,dm2k0d7
realmadrid,"Dangerous group, I think it's clearly the hardest one overall. Still, the goal is always to finish first and beat everyone but Dortmund fast-paced game and Tottenham's style with Pochettino can give us a headeache. 

I'm not bored by the fact that this will be the 9th and 10th time we will play Dortmund in 5 years (I think) because they are a very enjoyable team and provides entertaining games. Plus, their teams always change... 

 We'll have games in Dortmund in Weblay so added bonus for fans who can go cheer Madrid on the road :)",dm2jtzn

realmadrid,ffs. and now Spurs. Maybe the most challenging group.,dm2i9mw
realmadrid,ffs Dortmund again.,dm2hycd
realmadrid,"From purely defensive aspect... maybe. I would argue that Varane is better but it's the valid argument to have. 

However, in modern day soccer CBs are just as important with the ball as they are without. Our distribution travels all the way back to the backline for a majority of the time and all the offensive possessions go through Ramos. This is where he truly shines. He is the best ball-playing CB out of anyone in the world and it what makes him the best CB in the world. This is the aspect that Nacho is lacking in and this is the aspect we need the most out of our CBs since we play a very possession dominant football.",dm2hxo2
realmadrid,"Sooo, we got Borussia :)) but Barca got Juventus lol",dm2httr
realmadrid,Yikes. We got Dortmund. Same as last year.,dm2hsc7

realmadrid,Premier League is actually very entertaining. You can love Real Madrid and watch other games too. I think I actually watch more EPL games than La Liga games. I watch around 4 or 5 EPL games every weekend. ,dm2ft0h
realmadrid,Bayern is not an option,dm2fpsz

The kicker will be if he sticks around once he is only good off the bench. He could be the greatest super sub ever. Or he could leave us to start elsewhere. ",dm2e08l
realmadrid,"Thanks! Got the timings mixed up, so I thought it was starting an hour earlier than it actually is",dm2dzwb
realmadrid,"I feel like Marcelo is the overall slightly better player, but because of the legendary free kicks Roberto Carlos has this clout about him that obscures Marcelo's feats.  

Both amazing players that shouldn't necessarily be compared, but frequently are.",dm2dujn
realmadrid,"IIRC, last year it streamed live on YouTube? Might want to check UEFA, UCL and/or Fox Sports official YouTube channels. I'd also check RMTV once it starts, but I don't know if they're scheduled to air it.",dm2dpdk
realmadrid,He even took his backpack to bag the trophy on the way back.,dm2dlq6
realmadrid,"Pot 2: I'd like to avoid Borussia Dortmund if possible. Even though we beat them on paper, they seem to always give us such a headache when we play them. 

I'd also prefer not to be paired with PSG, but I'm also interested to see how they can hold up against a top team.

Pot 3: I don't want to face Liverpool, if only because I cheer for them in the Premier League and would like to see them make it to the knockout stage. 

Pot 4: RB Leipzig is the real wildcard of this group. Sporting CP also gave us a fight last year.



All in all, Real Madrid should end up with a more favorable group. We can't draw the real heavyweights of Pot 2 (Bar√ßa and Atletico), Bayern and Juve are in Pot 1 with us, and we have the talent and depth to overcome any starting XI these teams can throw at us.


¬°Hala Madrid!",dm2dkkn

realmadrid,He's also cheeky af. Who could forget his quickly taken free kick against Sevilla. ,dm20lm7
realmadrid,"Not sure about that. Tejero is hardworking and likeable but he wasnt even one of the best defenders in midtable Castilla last year. Achraf and Quezada are better fullbacks than him imo. Also he has played at CB like you said but he is pretty meh in that position. In the US preseason game against City he was very average and at fault for many attacks.

Nacho at his current age was Castilla captain and doing far better. Who knows tho, Tejero can still improve, he's young.",dm20k9r

Me. I would sign a defender to win the CL. I'd sign a headless chicken if I were guaranteed it could win us trophies.",dm206b5
realmadrid,"Of course. Don't get me wrong, I think Asensio is the best heir to Ronaldo currently. But that prime Ronaldo(23-24) was something else. Can Asensio reach those levels in a couple of years? We'll see. But Asensio's potential is incredible also and like I said, currently he's the best Ronaldo replacement available.",dm203wr

realmadrid,A younger Ronaldo = Asensio :),dm1z8ar

realmadrid,I'll take 8/10 all day!,dm1ytvi
realmadrid,"May have underrated him with the 7/10, bring that up to 8/10. I can tell you he's surpassed my expectations greatly and I really hope he spends his whole career here. Last year goal was incredible, he really is a smart dude.",dm1ysox
realmadrid,I believe he is more than just that but I respect your opinion,dm1yqq6
realmadrid,"He's solid and regular, a constant 7/10, who's pretty smart and disciplined and a great locker room presence. But that's it.",dm1yotj
realmadrid,le new cut inside man,dm1yn7p

realmadrid,Costs around 90k and has 69 speed? ü§î,dm1yh35
realmadrid,"I see what you're saying bro, but I think Nacho's rating is pretty well established in our team. He's been here for many years and the team is more than happy with him. It doesn't need claims like ""he's the best DEFENDER"", which seem a bit baity.",dm1yg4f
realmadrid,"No, but a lot of people wanted him to start ahead of Benzema and that was wrong in my opinion. Even though he had better stats. If you see what I wrote, you can see that I never said Nacho should replace Ramos/Varane, because of the same reason why Morata shouldn't replace Benz. For God's sake my username is a tribute to Ramos. I'm just trying to elevate Nacho's rating in our team, so that he won't be taken for granted. If anything I would probably have him replace Varane and join Ramos from how good his defensive ability is. However since he hasn't prove himself over a long stretch of games, I would NOT change him with our current solid, unstoppable, immovable, sexy partnership that is Varamos. ",dm1y8dv
realmadrid,So Morata was our best attacker last season because he scored more goals per minute than any other player?,dm1y1ok
realmadrid,That's exactly why I said I would not drop Ramos! I just think nacho is our most consistent CB and that makes him the best defender. It's like saying Morata was better at attack than Benzema because of his stats and whatnot but I wouldn't drop Benz because of his link up play with Ronaldo. ,dm1xwsp
realmadrid,"Of course it does. He plays as a defender, and at his position he's one of the best at defending (when he's focused, yeah) and probably the best ever at scoring. He's also the leader of the whole team, without discussion. He's a special player that will go down in history as Real Madrid's best defender, and you're trying to convince us that he's not even our best CB because for some reason positions only have specific roles, and if you happen to do something out of the ordinary it doesn't really matter because it's not your role and they should sign someone in a different position to do it. It doesn't work like that, bro. ",dm1xc99
realmadrid,That's exactly why I said I wouldn't bench Ramos or Varane. Because Ramos brings us the game winning goals. But that doesn't make you the best defender,dm1x44o
realmadrid,"&gt; True but that's not the role of a defender. Who signs a defender to win them the CL.

That's ridiculous. May as well bench Marcelo, since what he does best ""is not his role"".",dm1x0ps
realmadrid,"True but that's not the role of a defender. Who signs a defender to win them the CL. You sign a neymar or a Ronaldo. However that's why I'd keep Ramos and Varane as our partnership at the back. They're too important to drop. Ramos has his leadership, aggressive defending and game winning goals and Varane on his day can put any player in the world in his pocket. But for consistency and defending ability, I honestly think Nacho is the best. ",dm1wxmx
realmadrid,"He's good, he's hardly the best. Sergio Ramos can be stupid at times but no other defender in the world can win you a Champions League.",dm1wv1v

I've never really bought into the idea that he'll 'slow down' now that he's in his 30's, he's just going to get smarter, more efficient. He might not start 40/50 games a season any more, but I doubt that 20+ goals is going to be a problem for him for at least the next 3 or 4 seasons. ",dm1we92

realmadrid,"Madrid, Roma, City, Maribor. Roma makes it a tricky draw.",dm1w0el
realmadrid,"I don't agree, but I still fucking love Nacho. He's such a great team player, and probably one of the biggest Madridistas in the team. Have you watched his Campo de Estrellas episode? It was great!",dm1vx94
realmadrid,"Honestly, he seems healthier this season. Perhaps that injury at the start of last season really took him awhile to fully recover from. I mean, he has looked as good as ever (less dribbling aside) since the back end of last season. Partially because he seems to be playing smarter than he used to, as well.",dm1vvkx

realmadrid,How was Hagi's son? An article said he looked pretty talented.,dm1vqte
realmadrid,Thanks!,dm1vkz5
realmadrid,"Real are such a strong possession team these days, which is insane considering they have traditionally been known as a Phenomenal counter attack team during many of the Ronaldo years. ",dm1vj2i
realmadrid,"Thanks for soccerstreams, but I meant like a bar or something.",dm1vfpt
realmadrid,"That will come. He looked very talented offensively, and the end product will come given that he seems to have the technical capacity. 

How was he in defense, though? That'll be the big determinant in how much he can play against better competition when needed this season.",dm1vf9z
realmadrid,"I don't know why but it just says calendar cannot be added when I try to do it on mobile and it's prompts open the Google Calendar.

I'll try again from Desktop",dm1v5w4

realmadrid,r/soccerstreams,dm1uzpo
realmadrid,"i fucking love nacho he can play anywhere in along the backline and he saved us in the last few years especially when we played against atletico and ramos/pepe were out with injuries. And I almost forgot who scored the goal of the season last year? the flying scissor volley outside the box was ""magesterial"" nacho needed his teammates like a fish needs a bicycle. vamos nacho!",dm1uot6

realmadrid,Tell your buddy he got some damn good photos! Following him now.,dm1uhnv
realmadrid,"Damn, I was at the Bernab√©u this summer and was holding a black Asensio and a white Modric in my hands, ended up choosing the Modric. Might have to get this one from dhgate tho! ",dm1u81z
realmadrid,"I think this is the safest opinion, but it doesn't mean it's wrong. I can concede that Ramos and/or Varane are better because of plenty of reasons one should give. However I have yet to see Nacho put in a foot wrong. He's so damn reliable. When I try to think of Ramos/Varane mess ups, I can actually remember them, but Nacho (although hasn't played as much) hasn't done any major mistakes. 

Atletico away 3-0 La Liga (Nacho and Varane)

Bayern both legs (Nacho and Ramos)

Atletico 3-0 UCL (came on for carvajal at RB) 

I know that's a small sample size but lets ignore stats and see his actual performances. Against depor last game, he was so damn good. Maybe with more games his weaknesses can be seen but I have yet to see him do any significant errors. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Like you said he can walk in to any big team atm and I wouldn't sell him for anything less than 50mil. We are so lucky to have 4 amazing cbs (Vallejo I didn't forget you!).

",dm1u18e
realmadrid,"Zidane has really brought the best out of him. He represents the spirit of our Madridismo. However, I don't agree with the assertion that he's our best CB. He definitely is one of the better defenders in the world and would walk in to any top side in Spain except us and Atleti and maybe Barca. ",dm1tfay

Here are our captains ranking as of now. Since Pepe's departure, Ronaldo has filled that vacant spot, with Benzema succeeding Ronaldo as the fourth captain.
1. Sergio Ramos 
2. Marcelo

realmadrid,"His knees did hurt him. He can't run as fast or as long, he can't hit the ball as long, and he can't dribble as well. I feel like his physical abilities have decreased but he adapted by getting a lot smarter and efficient, so the end result is basically the same or even better sometimes. That's why he's such a good player.",dm1qpnu

I think a lot fans are jumping the gun for this. I know we've had a lot of success but this is football anything can happen and it's best to stay on the toes. 

Fuck Barca",dm1npby
realmadrid,"Is it long sleeve and authentic? If so, did you get it from the store or on the website?",dm1nli9
realmadrid,"Cristiano will be gunning for 30 goals a season 15 assists at *least* for the next 3 seasons until he is 35, im pretty confident in that and he will continue starting. My prediction is after that, if he is like zlatan and can still prove effective purely as a goal scorer without the assists coming then he can maybe start in big matches unti 37 but personally he will probably be benched a frequently because of his age so i dont know if he can continue until 40 here unless he likes playing less.",dm1nazj
realmadrid,"Kova is mutiple steps ahead of them at this point, ML &amp; DC will both develop in next 2 seasons but they arent ready just yet",dm1n4su

realmadrid,"I actually thought Mayoral as I was writing that, but then realized he's 20. Still very young though. But you're right, let's say even if Mayoral surpasses Ronaldo in appearances(possible if he plays regularly until the end) and goals(very hard achievement), there's still the thing about average goal per game ratio. The standard Ronaldo set is absolutely crazy and we need a very special talent(one in a generation type) to break Ronaldo's record.

Even then you'll ask, how more can you improve Ronaldo's ratio? The man already plays with something around 1 goal per game and that's ridiculous. What can Mayoral, Mbappe or whoever can do, 2 goals per game?

Ronaldo and Messi are really out of this planet. Lewandowski, Higuain, Kane, Aubameyang etc. are all following from behind.",dm1cxfa

Asensio as LW, Lucas RW, Llorente holding the midfield while Dani will partner with him and linkup with the attack. Since Mayoral showed no signs of playing wide, he will play central and stay in the box. Ronaldo is the free willy that will do whatever he desires lmao. But he'll probably cut inside from both flanks and link up with both Lucas and Asensio, while Mayoral waiting in the box for opportunities. At other stages he will play central and expect crosses from Lucas-Hakimi and Theo-Asensio. I especially await Theo-Asensio duo, they are going to be lit üî•üî•

realmadrid,"There's no guarantee he would've even started and become the absolute legend he is today. You're forgetting our club, up until recently, was very used to playing only star players. The system may have stunted his growth had he not gone through Man Utd. There's a documentary where he was able to drastically improve his scoring when his coach told him a tap-in goal = spectacular goal after noticing Ronaldo was trying to score spectacular goals, often times when passing would have been the better option for a future set-up for him. His development at Man Utd enabled him to develop the proper mentality to become the goal scoring machine he is today imo.",dm11816

realmadrid,Kova is injured. Asensio needs to start in the league.,dm10fmh
realmadrid,"Is Varane injured or something? He hasn't played since El Clasico 2nd leg. Or maybe since he's gonna be the starting CB with Ramos, Zidane's giving time to others since this isn't a vital match and he doesn't want to risk injuries?

Anyways. I'd go with Casilla; Theo, Ramos, Nacho, Achraf; Llorente, Ceballos, Kroos, Isco; Ronaldo, Borja. Rotational, but with Ramos, Kroos, and Isco in for some stability. Ronaldo in of course so he doesn't get rusty over his brief withdrawal. Llorente is similar to Kroos except he defends more and is quicker (not saying he's better than Kroos in any sense), so he can offer defensive stability while Kroos and Isco can focus on holding the ball. This will allow Ceballos to attack with Ronaldo and Borja.",dm10fkq

realmadrid,I don't think we'll see Casemiro play. He get's plenty of time as it is and Llorente plays in the same position. Zidane's more likely to play Kovacic or Asensio.,dm0ziup

realmadrid,Well he is our 4th top goal scorer of 2017 so far,dm0mcyg
realmadrid,"Yeah all the teams in the 2nd pot are actually equal or better than 4 teams in the 1st pot. 

But I'm not that worried , we will get a tough team from the 2nd pot for sure, but finishing first or second is not that important. 

As long as we don't get a tough team from the 3rd pot than I'm calm. Yeah we are obviously better, but some injuries + bad form early in the season + a tough team to contend with us on qualifying can be an issue. Mostly I don't want to get Napoly.

From the 4th pot CSKA is a pain in the ass because of the weather.

(Also I just want Barca to get Bayern) ",dm0lr3l
realmadrid,"Went ahead and fully simulated one draw, we got Manchester United, Napoli and Kobenhavn in the group with us. 

Would be an entertaining group that we should finish first in, considering we already played these teams and have won.",dm0lp8r

realmadrid,Brutal for them?,dm0joul
realmadrid,"This is great. Thank you for sharing. It also explains why all those ""pundits"" who felt that CR7 would ""lose his burst of pace as he gets older"" were so wrong: it wasn't just about the burst of pace, but about his intelligence in reading the game and in his movement that he uses to make that space for himself.",dm0j5ht
realmadrid,Would explain why the refs so far this season (SuperCopa + game 1) have been even more wretchedly anti-Madrid than usual.,dm0j0qk

The game allowed you to pick between certain nations, and if you guessed right, you'd get the amount of money you put in + the jackpot. Marcelo for whatever reason picked Croatia, and the machine hit exactly on the croatian flag.

realmadrid,"My take on this : Of course he's gonna play this card, it's good PR, but I'm sure he knows as well as anyone what he did after the card was wrong.

But that ref should not be involved in any match in La Liga for the rest of the season. Punish Ronaldo, but punish the ref too for fuck's sake.

Also a friend that lives in Madrid told me he read and heard rumours that we're in a cold war with La Liga/the refs because at the start of the season Perez complained about the quality of refereeing to UEFA and that, as expected, did not go well at all with the smug bastards we got in Spain.",dm0aiz6
realmadrid,"Really inspirational story, and despite winning 3 CLs amongst other trophies he's still such a humble and chill guy.",dm09xwn
realmadrid,As much as this thread will downvote anything disfavoring godnaldo we have to all agree that making contact with the ref in any way is wrong. Even if a ref blatantly costed you a match you cannot touch him in that way ,dm08ioo
realmadrid,"Ronaldo.

Isco has been the best / second best player in Madrid for the past year.

Pick one between Modric / Kroos / Marcelo / Ramos.",dm08537

Sorry I couldn't find a link in English, but it basically cites a report from Onda Cero about the date change, which also isn't official. Probably google translate will do lol.

realmadrid,I love these. Makes me at least feel more like I'm there down with the guys knowing what all was going on finally.,dlzqujs
realmadrid,"Nacho features for a small glimpse but it's one of the reasons why he is in this squad.

Very mature response from him, everyone needs someone to tell them to stfu and get on with it - what happened happened, focus on the game at hand.

Also he was immediately there to drag Schaer off Ramos in the event of something between the players (other than one flopping to the ground like a little bitch).",dlzq1ap

realmadrid,He continuously saved us in the 2015-16 season. Hope he remains healthy as well. So underrated!,dlzowaq

realmadrid,"Yup, the crazy thing is that people actually agree with him. ",dlzh4az
realmadrid,"It was a blatant shit call, it wasnt smart of cristiano but in el clasico in the super cup of spain a very important match it was one of the worst second yellows ive ever seen called, especially after the rival team had just been given a penalty of a large dive earlier. Refs just dont and should not do what that ref did so cristiano shouldnt have pushed him but the ridiculous severity of the situation you must give him slack..",dlzh2io
realmadrid,LOL I see you lurking. NikonWhite is currently on top and it's staying there buddy.,dlzg4cj

realmadrid,Lol Modric,dlzfk46
realmadrid,"Hahah woah there buddy. So, all my support for the last 22 years should go out the window because I am glad that Ronaldo pushed a ref? I was even glad when Pepe massacred those three Getafe players in the 2009 season too. And that was 10 matches. Sometimes your emotion takes over and you make a mistake. But please teach me how to be a Real Madrid fan, since you're so good at it.",dlzdpte
realmadrid,"How can you call yourself a Real Madrid fan and be glad that inarguably one of your most important players gets banned? Yes, this ban can have some benefits, but the fact that you're glad he shoved the ref is just outrageous. ",dlzdae2

realmadrid,Are you retarded? Everyone knows why he pushed the ref. There's no need to assume.,dlzctsc

realmadrid,"It's justified by the poor call, but Ronaldo needs to know better. He brought it upon himself, and regardless of how many times they appeal the ban, it will never rescinded.",dlzcgc1

realmadrid,It's never okay to shove a ref. But I feel like Ronaldo's was justified to some extent.,dlzc76r
realmadrid,"I know why he pushed him. 

The issue is when people think it's ok to shove a ref. ",dlzc1rt

I say league + copa is about the same as CL - though in Madrid's case this year they have no shout of being called best team in the world - not even the best team in the country.

They are two distinct skills, one requires vision ball striking ability and confidence, the other requires technical control ability. He has the former (even fancies a free kick), lacks the latter, and at Barca the latter is the most important quality. 

I think we agree, I was just trying to make the distinction on exactly where his shortcoming is, because it felt like you were too broadly dismissive and when negative attributes on players are noted it’s best to avoid broad statements in order to focus the conversation.

How can you say those two things simultaneously with a straight face? Ultimately 'playing with the ball' at Barca means that he will face a lot of high pressing so that is a skill he will need.

You just need to look at Pique and how massive a drop Yerry is from Pique's skill in this regard.

Also, it wasn't like his defensive performance was flawless. He made so many simple defensive mistakes during that game, including both goals and during that sequence of Sergi Roberto's red.

All I'm saying is that I do not think he will be a 3rd CB. He may be the 4th CB but he will not be the first choice centreback replacement (even if Vermaelen leaves). Mark my words.",1525543396,dyhzet1,t3_8h5qju,t1_dyhykeh

Barca,"Few things:

Griez is Is a complimentary player as opposed to a star player. He makes players around him better, he plays his role in the team, and most importantly, he’s a reliable player. That will work well for Messi, better than a player like Alexis/Neymar who, while very talented, are not complimentary but star players who need he ball and freedom to use/lose it. I think we will see Griez and Messi do very well together as Griez seems to make the players around him better.

What I am really excited for, something we haven’t see in a long time, is a a non-standard XI. Look at Madrid coming into a big game: how will they line up? Who starts and who sits? Zidane has the luxury of choosing Bale or Isco or Benzema or none of them. Barca have not been in this situation for some time, our XI has been somewhat static in most seasons to where when a big game is coming you can write the starting XI well ahead of time. Having the similar luxury to start Coutinho, Dembele, Griez or none of them will bring in a lot of tactical flexibility to the team so that we are always approaching games fresh with a unique plan. Let’s look at last year: Sergi/Pique/Masche/Alba, Busi/Rakitic/Iniesta, MSN. Perhaps Masche and Umtiti are swapped, but that’s not a tactical difference. The point is that any opponent knew our shape, personnel and approach to any large game.

He's either dribbling past people or looking for the killer pass or whatever comes up to his mind. And it takes him a second or two if he doesn't find that pass then he'll just made a normal one, which by the time he decides, the options have already been narrowed down and the options remaining are being pressured. 

It was painful to watch him at times during the Youth European Cup or something he was participating in last year and sometimes when he was playing for us.

We can murder anyone with Messi as false 9 and Griezmann and Dembele on both sides, together with Coutinho, Busquets and Roberto in midfield. Sorry but Suarez and Rakitic should sit on the bench. It's time to be exciting again. It's time to be BARCA again.

People don't realize how good Roberto can be as a RCM, because he never plays there. Being either a RB or a RM in a 4-4-2 that we should never play anyway made people forget how good Roberto actually is in his natural position. Give him the starting spot as a RCM in our own 4-3-3 and just behold the awesomeness. We don't even need to go to the marker to search for another starting midfielder.

My plan for this summer is to win the lottery every day, run a marathon under 2 hours, win the World Cup with Perú, the Tour de France on a unicycle, all while having a hot affair with Emma Watson, Emma Stone and Emma Green. For autumn I'm planning to settle down and marry one of my Emmas, create a startup and put Amazon, Apple, Volkswagen, Lockheed Martin and Saudi Aramco out of business.

    The plan for Barca this summer is to get rid of as many as eight players and then get a centre-back, a right-back, centre midfielder and potentially two forwards, depending on what happens. If they get Griezmann, you could argue they need another centre-forward if Paco Alcacer leaves.

Why would Barca need a right-back? I follow the team and I can guess that Barca needs a CM and two forwards, and a CB if Yerry Mina isn't going to be trusted (and honestly he isn't good enough to be Barca's 3rd CB).",1525527263,dyhlzpf,t3_8h5qju,t1_dyhgsqr

I, for one, think Barca have had a great season all things considered but this game will make alot of people's minds up in the matter.

Barca win/tie, then they should go invincible which would numb the sting of a Real UCL title. While if Real win, then Barca will fall back into the pit of despair where their direct rivals not only took the UCL, but also the invincible season away from them.

This game determines if Barca's season will be accepted as a success or seen as a shortcoming. Crazy, because this game doesn't determine a single trophy or spot in a bracket.

Tebas is irrelevant.

Barca,"How is it going to work on the pitch though? The top priority is obviously Messi so we should build the team to suit him. This season he's basically a 10 and we all know how well that has worked since he's exactly where he wants to play all the time. He also needs space in that area so it's crucial to have players providing width to stretch the opponent, meaning you need some wingers. Griezmann was a winger and Coutinho has played mostly on the left, but the both like to cut in so the width provided by either would be limited. That means we'll rely a lot on our fullbacks providing the width, but that's also a dangerous game since it might expose Pique and Umtiti too much, though I'm sure Valverde wouldn't compromise on that in reality.

I understand bringing in someone with experience who can play on the right since Dembele is still so raw, but I think what we'd benefit the most from is a more traditional winger. However, one benefit of Griezmann is that he has been molded by Simeone so he should play his part defensively too. Of course that didn't work out with Arda, but he also basically admitted that he doesn't want to work hard anymore before joining. Another upside is that we're basically building the French national team at this rate lol. In any case, I really hope it's a signing that Valverde has asked for. I'm certain he has a plan to incorporate him in a solid XI if that is the case, but I'm afraid that isn't the case and it's just the board buying a shiny toy to win over some socios.",1525524215,dyhk2iy,t3_8h5qju,t3_8h5qju

Barca,"Valverde should be judged against Enrique, not Pep. Pep had a lot of young (and experienced) players at his disposals, and Tito Vilanova who I suspected at least was nearly half responsible of their era success.

What Enrique had, was better than Valverde. Neymar, younger Iniesta, Bartra, and Suarez (in his first &amp; a half season), Xavi for a season, and Alves. Yet he depended on Neymar &amp; Messi for playmaking, pushed Iniesta deeper, rotation was fucked up in his time. He benched Bartra a lot in favor of Matheu, relied on Rafinha &amp; Gomes too much (and didn't solve Gomes problem with self confidence until he left), didn't care about Alba, not much defensive strength/tactic (just turned midfield as another defensive line) and basically when trident didn't work or Suarez &amp; Neymar didn't performed much, we were screwed unless Messi pulled our ass out of trouble. So much emphasis on fast counter attack that I don't really remember any other kind of play we had beside that style of attack &amp; the rest of the team supporting MSN.  [This](https://streamable.com/9tb6k) is pretty much typical of what we had in terms of Enrique defence. One thing from Lucho I rate really high was fitness related, he got Suarez &amp; Pique back to prime fitness.

What I saw from Valverde wasn't perfect, basically conservative, putting emphasis on defensive strength &amp; conserving energy, yet used midfield in more balanced fashion than Enrique, trying to change according to what the team had in hand but showed willingness to adapt. Tried new things without being too careless as in his conservative nature, didn't always get tactic correctly about 25-30% of the entire season, but compared to the last season of Lucho, that's much better. Lucho (along with the bigger source of problems, Rosell/Barto) dealt us the biggest damage in the last 7 years by moving firmly away from Pep/Tito legacy, and Valverde had to picked up his mess &amp; yet still delivered a double. 

If a player can be forgiven for not performing &amp; adjusting in his first season, Valverde should be given as much chance &amp; privillege.",1525522825,dyhja0d,t3_8gyhx5,t3_8gyhx5

&gt; The plan for Barca this summer is to get rid of as many as eight players and then get a centre-back, a right-back, centre midfielder and potentially two forwards, depending on what happens. If they get Griezmann, you could argue they need another centre-forward if Paco Alcacer leaves.

I know Guillem has become notoriously unreliable but lets not forget the reason he even grew a reputation in the first place was that he *was* reliable. He started chatting lots of shit which damaged his reputation.

Take it with a grain of salt but I don't think it's out of the question, it's very plausible he still has links with the club.",1525517587,dyhgsqr,t3_8h5qju,t1_dyhcel2

It still is a rumour and I wouldn't take it too seriously, however it did appear that Suarez was speaking on the Radio Station about Griezmann with certain authority according to the following article \(and also judging from the tone of his voice\) : [https://www.sport\-english.com/en/news/barca/luis\-suarez\-takes\-antoine\-griezmann\-signing\-as\-done\-6801124](https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/luis-suarez-takes-antoine-griezmann-signing-as-done-6801124):

&gt;In January SPORT revealed that Antoine Griezmann and FC Barcelona had a deal for the forward to join this summer. And now Luis Suarez has given away the fact Griezmann will join from Atletico Madrid on Radio Rincon, a station in Uruguay, as noted by Cadena SER in Spain.  
&gt;  
&gt;The forward said: ""It makes the club proud to bring players of this quality like Antoine, like Dembele and Coutinho came. He's a player who brings a huge amount, he has a lot of years playing at the highest level, always fighting. He rules up front for Atletico and that is fundamental.  
&gt;  
&gt;""He is not coming to take the place of anyone, but with the ambition of winning important things. He will be welcome.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Barcelona will have to pay Griezmann's 100 million euros release clause to sign him. Nothing is 100 per cent agreed but it seems like he will sign for 5 seasons and be one of the best paid players in the squad. He could form a new trident with Leo Messi and Luis Suarez.

Plus, unless Suarez is banging in goals again, he is the one that's going to be dropped.

Cuenca at least had a lot of tactical awareness and knew his limitations, which made him valuable.

Also, I completely disagree with your statement regarding Deulo and La Masia. La Masia still is what it was. Sometimes it simply puts a certain type of (influential) player too much on a pedestal. But we've had enough talented players who could've easily had more value than bought players (for instance: Grimaldo &gt; Digne).

The idea that every player that comes through La Masia must be the new Xavi/Iniesta/Messi is bullshit. I want new useable players in order to splash a lot of money on great ones. I feel a lot of sympathy towards Digne, but I hate the fact that we've wasted millions on the likes of him or Song or many others.

Barca,"&gt; But, we all know that we work well under a leader who support, encourages and motivates. And we tend to be complacent while working under a captain who isn't as motivating, and as strict. The successors of Puyol were never motivating captain, they were either very silent or calm. Puyol wasn't. I am tending to attribute our non existent fighting spirit to the lack of a born leader. We became a very beatable team these days, than under Puyol.

There are many types of leaders. To imply Iniesta is less of a leader isn't doing anyone justice. I'm sure Messi for one respects Iniesta as much as any other captains. You failed to notice those captains play with different teammates. How many players in this season played for us for more than 3 years?

To expect us to go out and get after teams like years past was unrealistic. Yes, the Roma tie was disgraceful and extremely disappointing but just as much blame goes to the players as valverde. They simply didn't show up and thought the tie was won after the first leg. Yes, his tactics were wrong and playing not to lose was a bad decision but I believe he will learn from that.

Tello at least stayed and plays constantly for Betis while he was also used a lot at Fiorentina. 
Deulofeu is the prime example why La Masia just isn’t the world class players factory it used to be. People keep getting upset for the lack of minutes of La Masia when in reality they are just not good enough. Even the ones that are viewed as generational talents like Bojan and Deulofeu are massive flops for the hype they rode.

Barca,"&gt; Liverpool deploys pressing in their game so Coutinho should be comfortable regarding the pressing game. Dembele had months off injured but just because he is injure doesn't mean that he shouldn't be learning how to properly press.

I'm not saying they don't know how to press. I'm saying that just because they might know how to, doesn't mean the rest of the squad aren't already tired.

&gt; Oh my ..... That’s why 34 year-old De Rossi and 30 year-old Nainggolan destroyed us with their pressing, right?

The exception isn't the rule. You will not find them consistently press like that which is why they couldn't against Liverpool.

&gt; It has little to do with age, it has to do with positional organization, anticipation and teamwork.

I mean there's no point going on if you believe pressing is possible without lots of energy, something you can only get consistently from younger players.

Knowing how to press is the mental part, but actually closing players down and physically moving? That's stamina. It's not possible to press without stamina, therefore, the physical part is the most important.

Barca,"&gt; Where was the pressing against Roma? And it's not a one off.

Yes, actually over the course of the season, it was in the spectrum of 1 off.  

And you do know Eibar is ranked No 1 in pressing in Liga don't you? Of course they were going to be testing. The team overcame that.  
Which Sevilla are you talking about because anyone who follows them consistently should be aware of their schizophrenic ways.  
Sure in the 2-2 draw they tested Barca but Final is a bigger game and Barca showed their quality there.  

Whether one wants to use Statistics or the Eye-test, its clear. Barca are a top pressing side this season still.  
And as mentioned the last time Barca pressed late consistently into 2nd half in months of April was under Pep. That with a squad average age as mentioned.  

&gt; Iniesta at 33 played every week, Rakitic came back from US after friendlies and was played so that the Invincible streak continues. 

Are you forgetting the fact that Pulinho had played over 80 games without a break since Feb 2017 hence can't be the starter all the time.  
In fact of the time he plays he is only on the field [57% of the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/85lh4i/remaining_fixtures_and_minutes_played/).  

Busquets also got injured for 28 days from March-April and Rakitic had to fill in for him and for the first time since Busquets rose to senior team at Barca there is finally a player who can play his role without sucking there. That meant he was going to be relied upon out of necessity.  
Furthermore Rakitic was on form, he was our top player post Feb along with terStegen. Players don't like to sit out anyway when they are on such a high. 
Furthermore again, Rakitic is matching his season minutes he had in prior seasons for Barca barring of course last season where he was rotated more(like everyone else) and that turned out fantastic as we all know. 


&gt; Alba was totally gassed 

Firstly he doesn't look gassed to me at all. He is still bombing down the flank as ever and covering in defense when required. And Digne has stepped in at between just fine. Even Sergi had to play there for a while when Digne was also injured. We don't have another LB to rotate in.  

Critically, Alba has played about the same amount he did prior to previous season, ONE which like with Rakitic needs special mention because he had a mini-falling out with Lucho, Neymar issues, and those ridiculous over the top rotations, such great rotations.  

&gt; Roberto who isn't a RB by trade looks completely jaded due to lack of stamina.

How is this a point.  
Vidal failed as a RB prospect and thus leaving the team with a new comer still adjusting to Barca and basically being in his 2nd breakout season of his career.  
And Sergi was the better RB despite Semedo having individual skill advantages because Sergi understood the system and combined his skill sets properly and deployed them at the right moments.  

YET, the minutes sharing was about par, meaning Sergi has only played about 4 and a half matches worth of minutes more at RB than Semedo over the course of the entire season.  

The team had no choice but to do this. Furthermore by the end of the season in gross terms Sergi would have played about the same amount of minutes he did last season and that was a season where there was no Semedo to share the load.  ",1525458391,dyg9s9p,t3_8gyhx5,t1_dyg256y

He is very good at creating space and finding the best pass or dribble out of pressure. Most times he starts plays receiving balls from the CBs and guiding the movements in the midfield until the ball arrives to the attacking players. He then will stay close to the AMs and wingers in case the team needs to change the pace or the movement forward. His highlights obviously show only the brightest stuff from him.

Barca,"&gt;The rest of the squad had already played 5 months of football.

Liverpool deploys pressing in their game so Coutinho should be comfortable regarding the pressing game. Dembele had months off injured but just because he is injure doesn't mean that he shouldn't be learning how to properly press. Pressing is more of a mental exercise knowing where you should be on the field and whom you would close down and what each players' job is. It's down to the manager to give these instructions. 

Again excuses... 

&gt;Pressing isn't about how good you are at football, it's about age. You don't need to be good at football to run a lot, you mostly need to be a young player.

Valverde had to play to the teams strengths, he made us very difficult to beat, he knew Messi is a genius and can play him wherever he wants and he will have a massive impact. He saw we had trouble with our midfield the season before he took over and saw a solution, an extra midfielder and giving Iniesta enough rest to recover.

It might not be beautiful football but it's not terrible, we have had great results and have been pragmatic when we have needed too, when Dembele and Coutinho came back in the team it improved the quality but we will see the best of Dembele next season.

Barca,"The thing people need to realize though, is that using Pep as a benchmark for ""attacking play"" is ridiculous and will only mean that people will never be satisfied. Some of the football the team played during Pep was so good that it was borderline impossible to improve upon.

We're already playing attacking football - we've scored around 90 goals in the league so far (the most of any team this year) and will likely end up at around 100 goals total when the league is done, which on average is just 10 goals less in a entire season compared to the least 7+ years.

I agree that we in some games this season could be playing more attacking football (we all know which games), but again, it's Valverde's first season and he's never managed a team as big as this, so naturally he's not gonna take too many risks in his first season. We also gotta take into consideration that he's got quite different players than we had when Pep was here. No midfielders even close to the trinity of Xavi/Busi/Iniesta in their prime.

I just personally hope we'll start playing more fluid/fluent football next season, with more effective pressing and being better in posession (essentially defending with the ball instead of without it).",1525450091,dyg0s74,t3_8gyhx5,t1_dyfpyre

Barca,"We ARE pressing. There is no 1 way to press, there are multiple modes of doing so. Do you think Barca, City, Napoli, Bayern and Liverpool all press the same exact way?  

We were in April and the team was pressing in the opposition half in the 79-80th minute. The last time this happened was under Pep. 

AND our primary starting 11 average age is 29.5, which at this level of grandpa age.  

Our press is positional block, its designated to covering the lanes and conserving energy due to the factors listed above, rather than what teams like City, Napoli do who press with intensity and are very directional from an individual point of view.  

And combined with the fact that our defense due to the shape we played in defensive phase it meant that we can deploy such a type of Press without be utterly shot come later months like we have been for 5 freaking years since Pep on this front.  

Furthermore, only 2 players were overplayed or not rotated enough. Pique and Suarez(Messi doesn't count for any coach so far in his career, he is a normalized entity).  
   
Everyone else got rotated as much was possible with the squad. A squad which was basically the same from last season due to Dembele's injury, Neymar gone so worse in attack. Suarez on horrible form, even worse. Iniesta not cutting it, Coutinho coming in January (by which point the EV led team had already done the business).

Barca," Since we're comparing him to Rijkaard, remember his first year here, we were in a transition like noone other since then, yet we managed to play the best football in Spain by the end of the season at a certain level that I believe if we were in the CL we could've had a big surprise, that of course, after a pretty disastrous start, losing El Clasico after half a century on Camp Nou after 1-5 in Malaga and being much behind Madrid and eventually we managed to finish above them, with chances to snatch the title after winning on Bernabeu but failed in Vigo and Zaragoza, we would've won the title by 1 point if after beating Real we would've won the last 3 games which I was hoping heavily in that May.
 The transition continued when we changed Kluivert and Saviola with Eto'o and Larsson; Cocu leaving and Luis Enrique, Overmars retiring, Quaresma clearly failing but we signed Deco, Giuly and fullbacks Belleti and Sylvinho and signed Gio after the loan.
 Damn, that was a transition, this isn't anything close to that. Dream came true in Paris, what days those were, couldn't sleep after we beat Chelsea in that swimming pool that night.

Barca,"Ha, as if Barca wants him back anyways.",1525445786,dyfw59v,t3_8gxnje,t3_8gxnje
Barca,"Nope, that’s an overly simplistic and speculative view. 

The real answer is wages.

A player like Arda (Song was the same way) would make most mid table or bottom table sides better, so why aren’t they jumping at the chance to buy or Loan him?!? It’s because they agree to a contract with Barca at a heightened wage rate and then when they fail to work out they are still entitled to that wage. 

So let’s say Arda signs here and we pay 40 for the signature and then his salary jumps from 3mm to 9mm per year (illustrative numbers). A mid table side would be offered the benefit of a 40mm player for free (on a loan) but that also means they have to pay him 9mm when perhaps his real value is 3-4mm. So even though they are acquiring a talented player’s services for seemingly free, they have to pay a wage above market for why they are getting.

This is what makes these players difficult to sell too, because a buyout price restructures that contract, so maybe a team only wants to buy Arda for $20 but that’s not enough to buyout his contract so it won’t work; the amount to buy out he contract is say $40 (because of the wages) and no one wants to pay that so they stay on the squad and we try to find a loan counter party, which is difficult because of the above. 

To put it in practical terms: you sign a 5 year lease on a nice apartment for $2000 per month. Then there is a recession and all of a sudden nicer apartments are going for $1000 per month, but you are locked I. For 5 years at $2000. Obviously it’s going to be hard to get someone to buy you out of that lease. Maybe for a year you are able to sublease it to your Turkish friend because the apartment has some special meaning to him (I.e. a reference to Arda in his home country), but after a year he realizes too that $2000 is too much and doesn’t want to buy you out of that lease either so you are still stuck with it.

I know this was long, but any topic of “why can’t we sell XYZ” always ignores this wage structure point which is probably the most germane to the topic. ",1525445783,dyfw554,t3_8gxnje,t1_dyfp03s

Barca,"- Would you consider this season to be a success? 
Yes, we won a double and haven't lost. Has our style of play been barca-like all season, no but regardless results on the field are what matters.
- If seniority wasn't an attribute, who would have you chosen as the captain of our squad?
I would go with Ter Stegen or Messi. Honestly I agree that he isn't a vocal leader but he's Barcelona through and through and when he needs to be vocal he's shown the ability to do so. Pique and Busquets just don't do it for me.

- Who we needs to sell?
I would sell Deulofeu, make the Turan and Douglas moves permanent, sell Denis Suarez and sell Gomes.

- Who to buy?
I would recall Rafinha, he's better than most of our depth central mids right now, recall Munir and give him a go. I would bring in Arthur, Griezmann, Odriozola, Sarr from Nice or de Ligt from Ajax (or both). We need some help on defense and adding Arthur would give us a good pivot central mid.

Your possible lineup for the next season?

                    ter Stegen
Semedo      Umtiti      Pique      Alba
          Busquets          Coutinho
                    Griezmann
Messi              Suarez        Dembele

Bench: Cillessen, Roberto, Sarr, Rafinha, Paulinho, Rakitic, Munir
Reserves: Digne, de Ligt, Vermaelen, Odriozola, Mina, Vidal, Arthur, Alcacer

Valverde is now coaching a small team. But I know you like a lot what he's doing. Do you see him becoming FC Barcelona coach in the near future? Is he ready for the challenge? 

Answer Johan Cruyff :
To understand what he's achieving, we have to see things in their context. 

The work he's doing so far is more than excellent. Not only the results, also the way they play.

If you watch Espanyol, you'll enjoy the way they play. And that wasn't happening before, even when they used to have better results. He is doing very good with what he has.

And I'm very happy that coaches like Valverde, Laudrup, Rijkaard, who try not only to obtain results, but also to implement a way of playing that people enjoy watching.

Unlike any of these guys, someone like Tuchel knew how to use Dembele proberly. He had more freedom on the pitch and he had the right to be creative, that's why he became their best player.

And that's because, like I said before, a system where Dembele isn't afraid to showcast his abilties while being risky. Being allowed to be a dangerous player he is and can be. 

For that you need a certain system and a manager with vision. Zinedine Zidane is proving to be one with Real Madrid. Pep... just look at the improvement of Sane and Sterling. Heynckes is great with that too. 

Valverde just isn't that.

You put young attacking talents like Hazard with the likes of Mourinho &amp; Conte and years later you'll start asking what went wrong? A player with immense potential, but never gotten someone to develop him and hone his skills.

That case would repeat itself with Dembele. Neither Dembele or Valverde can afford sitting on the bench or developing him because of his preference for experience and rigid tactics. 

It's a much better idea to sign an established player who suits Valverde

Valverde can maximize the potential of hard working midfielders like Rakitic or a defender just like Conte did with David Luiz or Mourinho with various players throughout his career. It just won't work with a young winger or a young attacking midfielder IMO.",1525431545,dyfkl37,t3_8grc1s,t1_dyfk2mu

Barca,"I see this competition argument thrown around a lot but I think it's a backwards description. Competition is a potential solution to the problem of stagnation due to a lack of change or variability in a player's life.  

It's the idea of losing the passion or drive to continue to perform due to monotony—like if you just get to a new job and are really hyped but slowly taper off as weeks go by. Competition for your role will make you work harder, possibly perform better, but is also just a very aggressive, more-stick-than-carrot way of trying to fix this problem (and therefore may even have negative effects depending on the player).

There are better ways to address declining motivation and will, but they're much less straightforward and it's not something which is observable from the outside. 

However, although Rakitic is clearly not as bombastically good as he was in the 2014/15 season, I think only a minority of that is due to psychological stagnation-related decline. I think the club atmosphere and a system which has made it difficult for our midfield to do well, and once those are fixed, we'd see a much more effective Rakitic.",1504831424,dmpk2bc,t3_6yp0k1,t1_dmpc6rb

I think it says something that when Messi said he was going to retire from international football, the entire older generation were willing to follow him into retirement. They probably feel tortured before, during, and after every game they don't win.

Google Translate (sort of bad, but you get the idea):

&gt;One of the great idols in the history of Colombian football, former player Faustino Asprilla said the word when speaking about the Argentina team, who, after a 1-1 draw with Venezuela at home, lives a drama in qualifying to qualify To the world cup. There have been criticisms for coach Jorge Sampaoli and for Lionel Messi's team-mates in the national team.

&gt;""How do they put him to play with various donkeys? Poor Messi, put him to play with the scum, players who are sold by the press as good. Let them play real players! ""He said in an interview with Espn.

&gt;""I do not understand the team, I do not know how they play,"" he added.

&gt;Cesar Luis Menotti, former coach of Argentina, also released the word against Sampa.

&gt;""Driving Argentina is not the same as running Sevilla, especially when you have Messi,"" he said.

&gt;Mena gave tips on how to play a tight team.

&gt;""Football is like a tango, you can not be running all the time. Need, pause, acceleration, pace, exchanges ... Argentina played so dizzily and this is the worst enemy of a player, ""he said.

&gt;And, finally, he was astonished at the performance of Argentina against Venezuela.

&gt;""The truth is that seeing all this was a shock. I played two games against Venezuela. We won by 7 to 0 in Caracas and by 11 to 0 in Rosario. There were 18 goals in two games and now I have to see those who can not win from Venezuela.",1504824304,dmpeqe1,t3_6you3p,t3_6you3p

Barca,"[My more in depth analysis on the competition within the squad.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/6vqoku/the_problems_at_barca_run_deeper_than_just/)
It's not about what the players do on the pitch, it's about their mental attitude. If they have grown complacent because they know their spot is always secure then they come into the game as a weaker player. You're not constantly fighting to stay on top within your club because there's no one else to fight with.

If you play for a football club in real life you also experience this, fighting to stay on top of your position. 

&gt; Rakitic did lose his starting spot for a few important games including the one against PSG.

This is the only important game he lost his starting spot too Gomes in the CL. The other 8 were all his. Mind showing me games where he didn't start which were important in the CL and Liga? 

&gt; I don't understand why only Rakitic gets all the critics for a situation

At the worst times of last year, during his worst games, he looked overwhelmed more than not concerned (in comparison to Arda for instance) and I remember him looking like he was giving his all but was failing at doing what he wanted. He doesn't strike me as a player who would stop trying because he has not competition.

The argument from ReneMS is also a relevant answer, Rakitic did lose his starting spot for a few important games including the one against PSG. Some could argue that he was rested but I remember some seemingly voluntary exclusion from the starting eleven in important games.

None of our midfielders looked good last year, not even Busquets in his more defense oriented role.

Barca,"Tino is harsh but maybe fair here. I still back Sampaoli to turn Argentina around if he is given time. Whether they fail to qualify for the WC or not he should be given opportunity to do the job. If they don't make it though I expect his head will roll. 

Sidenote: Tino Asprilla was one of my favourite players of all time. Such a gifted player but a classic headcase. He got in trouble one time for firing his guns into the air during a party, maybe a NYE or some such. 

Check this story below for an example:

Told by Peter Beardsley (ex Newcastle team-mate of Asprilla):

&gt; “We had an incident when we were playing Blackburn at home in the FA Cup. Kevin used to speak to Tino in Spanish and we were 1-0 down at half-time,” he recalled.

&gt; “Kevin has come in and he’s fuming. He lost it but it’s in Spanish – so we haven’t got a clue what he’s saying. He’s hammering Tino and all of a sudden he starts taking his kit off and we’re thinking ‘That’s strange’. He now walks between Kevin Keegan and Terry (McDermott) with no kit on bar a towel and starts running a bath.

&gt; “He’s looking at us and trying to talk to us. He’s fuming – but all we could hear was Tino running a bath, singing, whistling. And as a player we’re wetting ourselves thinking it’s funny but Kevin’s trying to keep a straight face, trying to tell us what to do.

&gt; “We ended up winning the game and Rob Lee says me to ‘Tell him well done on taking Tino off at half-time but why?’ So I asked him what happened and he said: ‘I told him he had two minutes to get his finger out or he’s off.’ Tino replied: ‘F**k you, I’m coming off now’.

&gt; “That’s how he was. He was mad – but nice mad. He was different with the ball – a skill that no one else has.”

Man I remember back then Newcastle beating Barca in the CL with an Asprilla hat-trick including one cracker of a header. Must've been 20 years ago!",1504818854,dmpa6wo,t3_6you3p,t3_6you3p

Barca,"What happens then? Nothing, probably.

LFP/RFEF has a rule that one not spanish club can play in the spanish league.
That place is used by Andorra in the fourth division. It would simply take a change of rule to allow Barça and the other catalan clubs to remain in La Liga.
Tebas said they would not allow the catalan clubs to remain, which is a clear lie.
Football is among the most important things for catalans and Tebas trys to get people vote No, because of that.
Loosing Barça (El Clásicos), Espanyol and Girona would be just as big a loss for La Liga than loosing Catalunya for Spain is.
That would be financially the ruin for them, as the main thing La Liga has is the 2 best clubs in the world and a interesting competition among these clubs. Thats what Ligue 1, Bundesliga and Serie A are missing.
So if the RFEF and LFP are not stupid they would give everything that Barça remains or they can resign instantly.

Else there would be the possibility that Ligue 1 would gladly take us with open arms, to get the new Clásico between PSG and Barça. Manuel Valls (ex primeminister France) even said that Barça would be welcome in Ligue 1.

But that is only the unlikely alternative as La Liga would never not retake Barça. They didn't even accept Neymars clause because of the third best player in the world leaving La Liga. They would never let the best/second best club in the world leave La Liga.

The only thing that might change is taxes from the salaries and political/economical stuff like that, but not La Liga related stuff.

Barca,"Bojan Krkic father returns to work for Barça and rejoins the technical secretariat of the club azulgrana. His return is one of the first consequences after the appointment of Pep Segura as the head of the football field.

The father of the player of Alavés was already linked for many seasons to the discipline azulgrana and was a basic piece for the technical secretariat of the Barça during several campaigns. He became one of Txiki Begiristain's trusted people and his reports were instrumental in incorporating or discarding certain players.

In June 2011, after the first year of Sandro Rosell's term, Barça announced that Bojan Krkic had stopped working with the club and did not renew the contract that expired on June 30 of that same year. His departure from Barca coincided with that of his son, who that same summer left the Camp Nou to test fortune in the Rome, directed by Luis Enrique.

When he left the club, Bojan Krkic was in charge of monitoring French football especially, while now in this new stage his main attack will be to control the area of ​​the Balkans, which he dominates to perfection given that it is Serbian origin.

In these years away from FC Barcelona, Bojan Sr. has worked as a scout for Manchester City, hired by Txiki Begiristain, and has also collaborated with the 'Què t'hi Jugues' program of Cadena SER, in which he had a section weekly. In it, he has occasionally revealed some signings that Barca did not make at the time, such as Luka Modric or the Belgian goalkeeper Courtois: ""I wanted to come, cost 3 million euros because he was an unknown goalkeeper. He was soon signed by Chelsea. My report should have been kept in some drawer of Zubi."" He also recommended Varane when he was a stranger, among others.

Barca,"1. If the wide AMs tucking in leads to more people in a 4-2-3-1, then there are objectively more in a 4-3-3 as the DM is more within the midfield than the can who can often be somewhat like a 2nd St. Even if they play more as a mid and less like a ST they're going to be less involved in the transition (which is our biggest problem area) so their role within the mids doesn't solve any issues we have. Further, if you're going to play messi as the CAM then he has very little defensive ability and as such is going to play more in the first, striker like role that I mentioned above.
2. The reason his average position is so close to the centre is because our front 3 swap around as much. Yes he drifts - he always has - but that is a strength rather than a weakness as has always been a part of out attack and makes it very hard for defenses to deal with as the pressure areas are constantly shifting. His role, and the way he plays is exactly what an inside forward does and his ""space"" is then occupied by a mid or by the rb. If he plays as the CAM he drifts everywhere, except the place where the team need that player to be the most - in the midfeild transitioning and building up to the attack rather than dropping away from it. The position you want Messi to be playing from your logic is as a False 9 ST, which means going to 2 up top, putting suarez on the wing or dropping him.
3. Now we have an actual rb and roberto will most likely be playing rcm a lot of that hole is actually filled. Attack is not null becuase you dont need to press at all points on the defence at once - thats inneffective - thats why we vary our attack and our pressure points and why that has worked for us in the past and will work for us once the team gels. Re. counters, thats nonsence - we're vulnerable due to a lack of defensive players which happens more in a 4-2-3-1 than in a 4-3-3 as we are able to essentially vary to a 3-atb in attack with a 4-3-3 with busi playing a halfback/anchor.",1504752902,dmo309j,t3_6ygmls,t1_dmnw6xj

Barca,"1) It hardly leaves the midfield ""barren"". If anything, it allows for more men in midfield, when the wide AMs tuck in. Normally, the two DMs (one of which is usually more attack-minded) and the CAM form the core of the midfield. That's a 3-man midfield, like 4-3-3.

2) The CAM role is the only one that really suits Messi now, without leaving big holes in other parts of the pitch. Messi is not an ""inside forward"" even. He plays in the centre, plain and simple. Yes, he drifts, but his average position is very close to the middle, unlike someone like Neymar, Deulofeu, Dembélé, etc.

3) Enjoy the massive gap on the right flank that means our attack is null there and we're susceptible to counters! 😛

Barca,"If you look around this sub you can find many of them but I'll bite:

- first and foremost he is coming from a league where he is dominating as the best player; soccer is a form sport and he is on high form the last year or so. Say what you want about the competitive level in the country, he's beating out other pretty good players and the confidence boost for his form is a real thing. 

- NT appearances have been positive, look at 5 goals in 5 games. He plays well for that great side, and before you say he has great players around him, he will at Barca too. He plays physically and more abrupt in his press with strong defensive work rate and also has good attacking positioning to get forward upfield. He can also put those attacking positions to use with a good shot.

- Good at set pieces which is a real stain of this Barca side that can get 10+ a game but convert so few (understanding of course we go short frequently) 

- someone to support and compete with Rakitic in the box to box position

Now if you want to talk about valuation that's an entirely different conversation that includes drivers such as (i) market timing for China which is midsession, (ii) seller reluctance as he is important to them, (iii) market shift post Neymar which has caused a material inflation to prices, (iv) poor operating leverage by Barca who just received an inflow of cash. I think we overpaid, but I think we did for Dembele too, it's more of a question of do I expect him to be additive to the squad and yes I personally do. ",1504741673,dmnuorw,t3_6yh4qr,t1_dmns8qy

While there's nothing truly overt to suggest any kind of negligence or malintent, the fact that the board has repeatedly attempted to take ownership of and twist events in order to further their own interests (lying about Messi/Iniesta's contracts, possibly about negotiations with Liverpool) and disregarded the views of others suggests either they don't care about the interests of FC Barcelona as a whole, or in their perspective the interests and FC Barcelona's are one.

Dude messi always has 3 to 4 players on him whenever he plays any match. That's how marked he is. That's how dangerous he is. Sometimes they even put 5 people like against Venezuela. And it doesn't even work then because he still creates chances. He cant be put in a fixed position because that would actually be his weakness and yes maybe the whole team may play better.....but they won't be an attacking threat because barca dont have creators anymore. Iniesta cant run all match creating. Busi cant. Alba cant. Masch can but he cant do it all the time as he has defensive duties.

Messi played out of his mind last year but if you look at stats it just looks like oh he scored a lot of goals but he did everything whilst outscoring everyone. This year if our wings are good and rakitic and sergi can sync, there's a good chance we'll get liga and cl and I'm not even joking.

And yet, here we are. Recently the ANC leader suggested that each citizen donates 10€ to pay for the 5.000.000€ bail money for Mas for the costs of the previous referendum.

Barca,"In a court of law (which is what determines if the junta is corrupt or not, that they used the club for personal riches), there is no proof regarding corruption (so far). Ergo your CMV is non sequitur in the sense that there is nothing to change- because you are right in essence.

As a foreword, some people have called me out and sent me pms saying ""old senile soci"" which I am neither, because the manner in which I spoke seemed to indicate (to them) some sort of affinity for the current administration. Again, that is also untrue.

Yet I do feel that the hate is warranted and I agree the word choices such as ""corrupt"" are a little vile, and unrelated at times, yet the sentiment is obvious- it's not so much as the corruption as it is the lack of transparency, player unrest, former President in jail for the incoming transfer of *the* one outgoing player this summer, expensive but failed transfers, Cruyff being ousted, sporting success *seemingly* shunned in favor of something else (though it must be said if that's what the soci wants then soci gets)...all these ""complaints"" that people will have to call something. I mean if it walks and talks like a giraffe, you can call it a hippo, but we still *know* it's a giraffe.

Considering the big picture, it’s surprisingly only rational that people call the board corrupt or incompetent or what have you. If we made sense with our accusations then we should not really get involved over 22 grown ass men kicking a ball (although for Barcelona it is a different case).

As a tangent, just like the constitutional court of South Korea recently impeached their former President (who is now imprisoned) on the grounds that she did not act in the best interests of the country and did not uphold the constitution, not a single one of us in the 15 peaceful protests amassing to more than a few million people would have evidence on our hands that she was corrupt— it doesn’t change the fact that she is. In addition the bigger prerogative is that the people asked her (repeatedly) to step down (on many grounds of…you said it “corruption”), then she should and must, regardless of the degree of her fault; the position itself dictates the presidency over the person—quite simply because the powers of the presidency are delegated by the citizens who elected her (at least that’s the zeitgeist of many a western constitutions- which we so cleverly adapted to after nine failed constitutions). For example, the clown constantly said she was not personally involved in the money laundering and other charges and suspicions, yet it doesn't matter-- when push comes to shove, that position entails responsibility not personal redemption or acquittal, and that in a holistic sense, ""the buck stops here."" She is still responsible for the random senior citizen that died on the street, and if she can't turn back time, the least she can do is step down. And that would be the least noble thing she could do: realizing that she is still responsible for a fault she did not personally commit. That's what the position is for. She didn't realize that and thus we impeached her. 

I often refrain from talking about politics in football, but Barca is not just football. It will be interesting to see how the vote of no confidence goes; we never expected the impeachment to pass the senate. If the socis don’t want Bartomeu anymore, they will have it their way because it quite literally says so and because they should—the autonomy of ownership dictates it. Even Bartomeu is not foolish enough to think otherwise. That’s mes que un club, not unicef.",1504728073,dmnj3a5,t3_6yh4qr,t3_6yh4qr

Barca,"&gt; Firstly, however you want it to work, that's not how it works.

It's not going to work 100% like that, because there are a lot of uncertainties involved, negotiating skills, marketing value and of course the fact that performance can't be measured like wind speed or temperature. But I think the core of the philosophy I'm defending is perfectly possible.

&gt;Secondly, if you honestly think that Roberto or Denis can perform at Iniesta's level, you're sorely mistaken. Did you just watch Iniesta for Spain? When he's managed properly, he's still by far the best CM we have.

I didn't watch the game but do you honestly think you can take one game as a benchmark for Iniesta? Iniesta missed 19 games due to injury last season and has already been injured this season.

Also, what is ""properly managed""? Because if properly managed means playing him less (e.g. not more than 30-60 minutes), that has to be considered in his wage.

Top performance, even an amazing game, that's a secondary criterion for me. Titles are won over several games which add up to several thousand minutes. It's also a team sport, meaning that a midfielder playing amazing in attack role, is less amazing if he can't keep up with his defensive duties.

I'm much more interested in average performance over all games in the season, that's what puts you in the position to win places. And that's why I think Roberto or Denis are probably more valuable to the team right now.

Better than what?

He has gotten standing ovations in the Santiago Bernabéu.

There is not much more than ""better"" for Iniesta. He has profited just as much of the Club as the Club has from him. If we are gonna see less performance of him, it's fair that his wage sees a cut proportional to that.

And it's definitely a mistake to let him decide when to leave: that's something the club/coach has to decide as soon as he doesn't have the level to play for us (probably in a couple years), just like Pep did with Ronnie.",1504719604,dmnb7zb,t3_6yf1ds,t1_dmna61a

Regarding Alves, the problem with him was that we had no ""native"" for that position. Might have made sense to pay him 10m net, but if we had Semedo definitely not. 

Also, I'm not sure he was that great at Juve. My Italian friend said he was inconsistent, just as the years before with us. And at the end he played often as a midfielder afaik.

&gt;MSN. As long as Iniesta is willing to come on as a super-sub in quite a few games, like Henrik Larsson did in attack, I think he is worth the money.

He is worth the money depends on how much money we are talking about. 90%, 70% or 40% of his wage at his top level? I would say the latter... and with automatic reduction mechanisms.

Do you honestly think Iniesta does not have salary expectations? And that these expectations might be too high?

I hate this board as much as you do, but IF (!) they are beeing *reasonably* tough on Iniesta about the new contract, I'd consider that one of those rare occasions where they have gotten it right.  Iniesta 2017 is not Iniesta 2009 and Iniesta 2018 will be worse, so the contract must be adjusted accordingly.

Now I'm assuming it's a money issue and that Barto is beeing reasonable, which might not be the case, of course.

I think the 433 just isn't working anymore messi keeps being forced to drop deeper to get play going and abandoning the right wing in the process.

Also your point of linking articles rather than posting, it's because some people who I know have bad wifi per say in their country so opening up links will just keep loading and crashing etc. I just want people to have an easy read rather than redirecting them to another page.

Second Thiago left because we weren't giving him enough playing time, it was a clause he had that if not given enough playing time his release clause could be triggered and a cheaper price, I love this club but we screwed up here, we didn't show enough faith in him and we should've watched out for the clause. We need to stop acting like it's his his fault and he should've waited, he's honestly proven to Barca he was ready.

Barca,"Unrelated... 

You agree to an original contract; Madrid sign players at lower starting wages and high release clauses. 

Player perform well and get an extension, this leads to negotiations in which both wages and releases clauses rise. So when Sergi Roberto for example is renewed, and they want to raise his clause and extra $100mm h might agree but only if his wages go up and additional $x. 

The way that Barca pay the players  higher than Madrid and the way that Madrid have higher release clauses are unrelated to this particular discussion, the key point is that if you want to raise a release clause, on either end, it requires other contractual concessions like longer duration or higher wage

Ronaldo 1 billion release clause at his signing was a joke because at that time no club in the world would be able to put 200m in a player. Ceballos, Isco, Marco Asensio getting 700m clause is not a joke but it's adapting to the market conditions since you have state backed countries willing to pour hundred of millions on a single player.

When you sign an extension you open up the document to negotiate certain points, with the precedent used as the starting place.

He was also the fastest player on the squad, which is the type of thing that means more in training to drive the other players than any sort of on field impact. 

Make no mistake he's no David Villa, but he's also no Alex Song. He came and did exactly what he was bought for and never made any negative press.

For me he was a great success and the model of an older signing to fill a void. ",1504643752,dmlwcaa,t3_6yaj7n,t3_6yaj7n

Barca,"True and I agree with you, just want to add that it's not really the same though. For instance if Neymar wanted to leave and had just 10m release clause, the new club would just have to pay the 10m and Neymar could get a bigger signing bonus and higher salary instead, no need to pay higher than 10m since that's the release clause.

A player could also leave very late and fuck the team over like Neymar did out of the blue. With a high release clause you can steer it in an appropriate direction. ",1504643274,dmlvvof,t3_6y8wfo,t1_dmlmu6c

Barca,Messi is 30 and he'll play until he is at least 31. Messi is the greatest ever but (hypothetically) getting three 23 year old prodigies for 100 million each will surely add far more value than Messi would at 31. Messi retiring at Barca would mean his value simply disappeared. Is him staying for 2 years really worth the 300 million that could insure Barca for another 10 years? Even Veratti and Dybala combined would add comparable value but that value would persist for ~10 years while Messi's will be 2-3 max. Anyone who thinks such additions cannot win a CL given Messi's exclusion is deluded. Not to mention that by that time it is more than likely Coutinho would have arrived and therefor we'd have a Busquets/Veratti/Coutinho/Dembele/Suarez/Dybala team.

&gt; Lol

At you 😂

&gt; If you're from Melbourne you should root for Melbourne FC and help them grow in size and prestige. If you live in Seattle, root for the Sounders and help them grow in size and prestige.

Again, who are you to tell me or anyone for that matter what to do?

&gt; Rooting for a team in another country only helps that league while hurting your country's. Rooting for your home club helps make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies. Plus you're able to understand the club, culture, and language and able to consistently attend home matches.

So according to this moronic logic of yours:

Luka Modric should go back to Croatia and play for Zagreb to ""make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies.""

Toni Kroos should go back to Germany to play for Bayern and ""make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies.""

Casemiro should go back to Brazil to play for Sao Paulo and ""make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies.""

Cristiano Ronaldo should go back to Portugal and play for Sporting and ""make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies.""

Kovacic should to back to Croatia to play for Zagreb and ""make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies.""

Varane should go back to France and play for RC Lens and ""make that club bigger, into a team that consistently wins trophies.""

Are you a bigot or something? Lol. Again, Real Madrid is an international club from players to coaches to supporters.

realmadrid,"That's sports in general. When you perform you're lauded as one of the greats but as soon as you start to lose everyone is after you. This is especially true for madrid because we've been so dominant and the team is constantly under the microscope of everyone. Start of the season shows this well, Zidane's job position was being questioned, pretty much the future of the whole midfield was  being questioned as well as keylors and the whole attacking front as well where we've seen reports of Ronaldo wanting to leave and the whole Ronaldo to PSG, Neymar to Madrid rumors also.

What's more, is that the team players are not necessarily shoving how many titles they have into everyone's faces, but they consistently project the culture of winning and greatness (exactly what I think you should show playing for Madrid) but people don't really like someone who isn't humble while dominating. It's one of the reasons why everyone hates Ronaldo and love Messi, while both are undeniably the greatest of all time in their own respect, you have two polarizing demeanors and Messi's demeanor is just a lot more acceptable to an average fan.

In a world where money was infinity and there wasn't FFP, I would rather have De Gea due to the way he ""tackles"" (I don't know the English term for leaving the goal). I.e. if De Gea came for free like Courtois is trying to come, well, I would take that. We don't live in that world. I think Navas is an awesome GK and I would rather see Flo focusing on a striker instead of De Gea.",1525537811,dyhukco,t3_8h3an9,t3_8h3an9
realmadrid,"I don't think OP meant it as a circlejerk. Zindane is the best manager in the world of Soccer, you can't really argue against it. Sure, other managers with lesser money/players have given great teams a run for their money sometimes but that's the beauty of soccer: nothing is written in stone and for 90 minutes, or 180 minutes at times, glory is up for grabs. 

I don't think he even meant it as a comparison, there is absolutely no comparison between the two. Different leagues, different tactics, different teams, different backgrounds, different milestones, and different goals. 

I think what he does mean is that if Real Madrid were to lose the cup, Klopp will be hailed king of all that is Soccer for eternity, whereas Zidane winning it just means he's lucky 3 times in a row with virtually the same team.

realmadrid,"Agreed. I think the Zidane impact is comparable. The team now compared to Ancelotti or Benítez is considerably better. 

That being said, I remember reading on this sub a long time ago when ZZ won his first champions as a manager that perhaps his success is an indication of a new approach to hiring managers. Zidane is an entirely homegrown coach, kind of like Del Bosque was. 

And I do not mean because he was a Madrid legend. In addition to that status, he has an incomparable institutional awareness in Madrid. As in, he´s been in the club´s ranks post-player in several positions and has observed the modus operandi of the club from every perceivable, relevant angle. 

I think hiring an individual with this CV is infinitely preferable to hiring a coach from another team or league that has won 3 or 4 titles. Even with minimal coaching experience before managing the top team, ZZ knows better than anyone, even Florentino, what the instrumental components to Madrid's success are. I think we should stick to this approach. ",1525536511,dyhtg3e,t3_8h74qb,t1_dyhstmd

realmadrid,"Zidane won all his titles hithertho with Benítez´s players. He has spent virtually 0 euros, honestly. I see your point, though. Madrid has more spending power and they start off in a much better position than Liverpool merely because they *are* Madrid. 

I agree with what you are saying, but that does not diminish Zidane's accomlpishments in the least. If he had come, and like Guardiola, made sweeping line-up changes (2009 Barça) or broke the bank like Mourinho at Manchester United, then I would agree wholeheartedly. He merely adapted, very successfully, the players that were already there.

I think being succesful at a club like Madrid or Barça would infinitely have more merit precisely because of the status of the club as a mandatory finalist, if not winner of all competitions. 

The lockeroom full of world-class players that, more often than not, the manager has to convince them to respect him. The board demanding consistent, convincing success. The press and the expectations work against you. Even when you succeed, there is more criticism than praise. ""Why didn't James play? Why didn't Benzema score? Madrid only has 3 clean-sheets this season, so do you prefer Kepa or De Gea? Is Zidane doing his best to accomodate Bale?"" These are Madrid problems and they do not come just from the press, they come from the directiva as well - who do you think owns the press?. Even when Zidane won the league and champions league, the press and the board wanted more (""y la copa, qué?"". 

He has to succeed and meet/exceed their standards with the players they personally prefer. Because there will always be headlines with ""What will it take for Madrid to win a treble?"" until they do and then they'll ask about the sextete. ",1525534452,dyhrmej,t3_8h74qb,t1_dyhql0k

Right now he’s doing a great job, but it’s certainly easier when you have access to some of the best players in the world. More important than talent, there are several players on RM with strong mentality. CR, Ramos, navas, are players that make a huge difference in games.

realmadrid,"It's not a problem with his running, cause he covers a lot of distance during games. The big problem is he can be a defensive liability many a times and has a knack of switching off at times especially when we aren't controlling the game. Counters are a nightmare for him cause he's usually off position to defend them and doesn't have the legs to track back easily to make up. At his position, we need a 2 way player and our front 5-6 is usually pretty offensive that he needs to do a good defensive job which he struggles to do cause he doesn't have the defensive awareness and discipline to be a solid rock in a deep role consistently. Let's not forget he played a much more attacking role for Bayern and usually had multiple mids behind him to cover. 


And it's not just him, our side lacks defensive discipline in general and we do switch off many a times defensively. The amount of goals we've conceded is no mere coincidence. I hope the club realizes how poor the defense has been and decides to bring in a change in culture. A big reason Barca has won the league is cause of their defense and we need to rectify it if we want to challenge next season.",1525505707,dyhca0m,t3_8gy09n,t1_dyfqkaj

realmadrid,"I have always loved Benzema and the way he combines with Ronaldo. We consider his value to the team, not as a striker but the overall value he brings to attack. But I think Eden Hazard is a better creator and also can play anywhere in the attack, either wing, central or as false striker also. Also, he is the best player I have seen who can receive the ball on the turn and his back facing towards the goal. I always our way of playing football, but most of the time we don't penetrate through the middle, we combine nicely than launch it to our fullbacks. Isco is the players who dribble well, but he doesn't do it on purpose all the time. I have been watching Chelsea matches due to this man only, but I would love to see him with intelligent players. In Chelsea his link up with only Fabregas is breath-taking,  but here in Madrid we have so many intelligent players and we keep the possession, so he would be an ideal candidate for me. He has always admired Zidane, and neither does he has any ego whatsoever. I believe his link up with Ronaldo will be on fire, better than Benzema I can say on the basis that the way he combines with Giroud or Morata and they have played together for 6 months to the 1-year maximum. One criticism I often hear of him is that he is not consistent enough, I do think it's valid to some extent, but in big games, Chelsea never like to keep possession of the ball, so he has less impact but still, he always has those magical moments which turns the match in seconds. What is your opinion please do share, and I don't think we are utilizing the bale, so should he voluntarily go to EPL, as it would be best for him to not waste his prime years on bench.",1525501239,dyha9wh,t3_8h5p0f,t3_8h5p0f

realmadrid,"I think he had a bad game against Juventus in the second leg for sure, compounded by that awful blunder. However, I thought keeping Bayern to 1 goal given how at least the first half played out (I could not watch the second half at work) was huge for the team. That we even equalized before half was indicative of the grit the whole team showed after going down a goal.

This last game was different. He had some incredible saves, was involved in the cluster fuck first Bayern goal (though just as at fault was the defending), and thought James' goal was just good finishing. The only game out of the last 3 that he was truly bad in was Juventus, but to be fair that could have cost us advancing so it's a legitimate gripe.

realmadrid,"That midfield 4 was so glorious when in possession but it wasn't strong enough on defense. Kovacic's defensive positioning was awful at times and Kroos didn't even bother to defend. I hope Zidane finds a way to play the same midfield with Casemiro in for Asensio. Casemiro is not very good in possession but he is absolutely needed when the other team has the ball.

If Zidane could organize the team in a 4-4-2 when defending and a 3-5-2 when attacking (Casemiro staying back with Ramos and Varane to allow Marcelo and Carvajal to push further up and provide the width) then we a midfield 4 of Kovacic, Kroos, Casemiro, and Modric could work.

Defensive formation:

    Navas

    Carvajal - Varane - Ramos - Marcelo

    Modric - Casemiro - Kovacic - Kroos

    Benzema - Ronaldo

Offensive formation:

    Navas

    Varane - Casemiro - Ramos

    Modric - Kovacic - Kroos

    Carvajal - Benzema - Ronaldo - Marcelo

realmadrid,"One of the reasons Ronaldo was so quiet during the semis is because not only did Bayern do a great job to cut off his supply, they guarded him well also.

That being said, I don't think Liverpool's defense can handle that the way Bayern did. Hopefully we can see Ronaldo shine, as well as others. I'd love a goal a piece by the BBC. ",1525438260,dyfozuw,t3_8gkpnw,t3_8gkpnw

realmadrid,"navas already down when james went for the ball because it was deflected. He went straight at james after he get back on his feet but that wasnt enough. He is fast. And navas is an offensive goalkeeper which relies more on his speed and athleticism while de gea is defensive one which relies more on his position and skills. Navas suits madrid style very well. How often did u see de gea leaving his line during set pieces? Or leaving his box to clear the ball? 

And no. I always watch epl match because it fell right at night time here. Not only recently but always. I said sometimes de gea stumbled. Not moving and just ball watching the ball because he cant react to that. And he always have his feets wide open which make it hard for him to make a reflex saves whenever he face a sudden shot or deflected balls. And he stumbled. Just like that. Go and watch. I still rate ddg higher. But navas reflexes is still miles ahead of him. ",1525437367,dyfoavk,t3_8guafw,t1_dyfnfx5

Just because you make an attempt to dive for a shot if you miss it's still a goal. 

If anything what your describing is down to positioning and ambidexterity not reflexes. Navas literally made a mistake in the last game which was down to reflex. He couldn't change his footing position fast enough and got nutmegged by James' shot. ",1525436203,dyfnfx5,t3_8guafw,t1_dyfmk95

realmadrid,"It's not about going missing. He was pressing at the wrong time and creating loop holes for Bayern to exploit time and again. It basically fucks up any structure we have. In the match thread, plenty of people pointed to that. Loads of time, players would go past him with ease and face our back four. As an experienced player, he should know better than that. Also offensively, there are good number of times he gave away with no pressure on him, which is something we can't afford to do against Bayern. And then to top it off, that last min, where Bayern were piling the pressure and he went on the ground at the slightest of touches multiple times and that would distract the team as well as Bayern would continue with the play whilst Kroos is trying to get the ref's attention pointlessly. That was against mentioned in the thread. He's been underwhelming the last few games more or less and on form and against a record scoring side like Liverpool , I would personally take no chances with our defense. Liverpool take most of their chances.",1525433566,dyflpnp,t3_8gy09n,t1_dyfla3e
realmadrid,What happened on Bernabeu against Bayern was we had to run a lot chasing the ball and in attacking too. And Toni is a player who doesn't run much. That's why he was seen nowhere in the pitch. Just my opinion. Correct me if I'm wrong.,1525432828,dyfla3e,t3_8gy09n,t1_dyfjiq7

Well If I was about to do the same and rate Madeid fans based on you man.. you dont wanna know. My childhood bestfriend is an RM fan, therefore I have great respect for the team, but some things you mention dont make much sense. I admit, Porto side was not the strongest, but I honestly believe that Man City side outweights both Juve and PSG in everything or at the most, Id say they are just as good as Juve and Bayern. Rome beat Barcelona 3-0 at home, the Barcelona that trashed RM back in autumn. Yes, they didnt not get a pen, we all know. We didnt get a pen either, Florenzi didnt get a red card (nobody mentions?), They were gifted a pen at Anfield to compensate our 4 goal lead.

Seriously, just look at Firmino. The guy wasn't half of what he is today, but this season even if he has basically no angle he will somehow find space and shoot, just look at his shots against Roma.    
     
Salah is easily a one man army, similar to peak Ronaldo. While he excels when Firmino plays for him, he's not afraid of coming alone from the flank, make a dribble and shoot out of nowhere.

No I wouldn't put it like that. Kroos is his own flavour of press-resistance which is no less effective than Modric. It's probably unfair to both to try and say which is the more resistant. I was trying to say that Kroos needs to be in the 11 otherwise their press will overrun us. Bad form or not, for this alone he needs to play. 

&gt; I think the weakness in our system with Kroos is when we don't have the ball,we can get overrun and Kroos almost never covers for Marcelo like Modric did for Vazquez the other day

realmadrid,"Even though Liverpool's front three will be a very potent threat, and a lot of people are underestimating these 3 (they scored the most goals in the CL in its history), the individual lack of quality in their defence, lack of experience and their routine loss of concentration in the last 10-20 minutes will surely be capitalized by Real Madrid.

I have watched almost all of their games this season. The key strategy is to play deep, man mark Firmino, play a lot of long balls to wide areas or especially to the striker occupying Lovren. You all should target the areas between Lovren and Arnold. Their positional sense is woeful and they lose concentration easily. Lovren simply cannot deal with long balls and his anticipation to these balls is really poor. You can also leave men back to prevent a counterattack in the wide areas if you are leading (which is obvious) but honestly I don't even think you would have to do this. These all would completely nullify their attack which is the strongest (and only) force they have. Mourinho did it and Liverpool didn't even have a shot on target. 

They will start at a frantic pace, high tempo, with high pressing and very physical in the beginning. I think Real Madrid's experience will help here as I don't think they have come up against a team as equipped to deal with this. You should play it slow and possession based since you're press resistant and save your energy. The smartest thing is then go gung-ho at 70 minutes and onward as they always collapse around this time. Also, their squad is bare. If they get any injuries again, their subs are utterly woeful (seriously, their backup striker is Ings and Solanke, they have no more central midfielders to play literally.) If Real Madrid go into the break drawn or even leading, you will win for sure. 

Real Madrid have so many options to win here, I can see a big margin, maybe 4-1 or 5-2 with 2 goals coming in the last 10 minutes.",1525410171,dyfac6v,t3_8gkpnw,t3_8gkpnw

I mean, as soon as the final whistle was blown, I noticed Benzema running into the pitch directly towards Ronaldo and hugged him like they both are brothers. And the way Ronaldo embraced him felt so heart warming. I know their emotions are at the peak in those moments but that's something I felt so good about Ronaldo and the entire team as a whole as to how happy they are in the dressing room something like an extended family. Any thoughts about my point? I know Ronaldo moves a little more close with Marcelo but it looks like he became more close to Benz and Bale of late than how they were before. I mean, the penalty incident also proves the point. This also shows how much of a leader he is from with in. Feel free to discuss more. Ignore if you feel the topic as nonsense.

realmadrid,"As a Madrid fan who's been following Liverpool for a while, I think you must be either deluded or too arrogant if you think they're overhyped! It's true that they were shite when Suarez left them and get replaced by Ballotelli, but Klopp's made this team very entertaining and threatening at the same time! 

Sadio was their best player last season, but he still performs very well such as the 2nd Roma game despite ""allegedly being overshadowed by Mohamed  Salah"". Firmino wasn't scoring as much last season, but this season we wish Benzema was performing as well as him. They have a similar role in the teams, but Firmino has much greater defensive work rate. I am happy that Big Benz was crucial against Bayern, but his season is still rather overwhelming! There is no explanation for Salah, he is just so gooooood! 

Overall, you gotta give it to Klopp! I just can't hate the dude and I found myself rooting for them in the EPL! This Liverpool is arguably even better since Coutinho left the team! Anything can happen in this sport, but those three scored and assist plenty this season! I'd argue they are the most lethal opponent we will face on the UCL!

And let's not kid ourselves! This year Ronaldo may be better than last season, but I much prefer the team we had last year! We had better depths, competition, and experience. Luck has also been on our side up to this point. Overall, I think we have better defense and definitely midfield, but we can't underestimate them at all! I think we can definitely win but we gotta get our shit together too! I have so much respect for Liverpool as a team and I can't wait to see the final!

But! We don’t play against defenders like Varane, and the only keeper in football on par with Navas is De Gea - and he shut us down. So yeah, your defense is better than anything we’ve come up against and that makes me nervous. Our keeper situation isn’t ideal, you clearly have the advantage there, which is really scary.

You have to admit though, that this is a tasty, tasty fucking matchup. I’ve watched more Madrid and Liverpool games than any other teams this season - I’ve watched all of them and some multiple times - and this Champions League final is a dream.

realmadrid,"I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it’s a peach of cake.

realmadrid,"Salah is all that - this year. Firmino is good, but not that good (as some people think) and I didn't heard a lot about Mane.

The thing with Salah is that he's having a beastly phase, buy we don't know if he will stick or not - or even if he can sustain that without blowing up his muscles and becoming injury prone. All in all, I think the crazy way Salah moves makes the lives of Firmino and Mane easier because it's not that hard to eff things up and leaving one of them unchecked. I think it's possible to play smart again them - the thing is, you need to press and score a couple goals just in case, which makes playing again Liverpool tricky.

If you consider the whole team, I think Bayern is a lot more dangerous, due to the quality MFs to help the attackers.

IF Benz starts scoring again regularly, we can trash some serious teams, while right now we are just winning things. Imo, Liverpool is the underdog, that's why some people are rooting for them. Since we did the most during away games on the last couple phases, we just have to not get caught offguard while doing our thing.

I don't know where you get your stats from,but according to whoscored,Modric made more tackles and dispossed the enemy team 4 times compared to Kroos' 0.The average distance covered means absolutely nothing,Kroos has 1 pace and that's slow.Notice that for the first goal of Bayern yesteday and last week,he is casually jogging back while the others around him are sprinting back to cover.

BTW, Kroos and Modric both had the exact SAME  number of ball recoveries **\(7\)** last night. So, this ""Kroos pulls out of challenges"" thing doesn't really make much sense. 

Moreover, stats show that Kroos covers on average the second most distance after Carvajal in the Champions League. And is often the first one to take the initiative to press. 

And again, Modric, offensively didn't have any better impact than Kroos did. When we had the ball, Kroos was the one switching the play, helping us escape the press and create overloads like he always does.

realmadrid,"You are completely disregarding the formation played, the tactics and the opposition. 

Kroos and Modric were the ones pressing the CBs most consistently, along with Lucas and Benz. 

If Bayern by\-passes that press, the issue is with the pressing structure or the effort being put by the players involved in pressing. 

Yesterday, there was little issue with the effort of the players but a lot of issues with the actual defensive structure and the pressing structure. Because Bayern kept by\-passing the midfield as if it wasn't there. 

Modric might have seemed great because he ran a lot, but that doesn't mean he was very effective or imposing. He wasn't because Zidane's tactics and approach didn't allow him to be. 

Therefore, it is rather naive to ignore these things and conclude that Kroos  was terrible.

What also makes them threatening is that their league is already wrapped up when we get to the later stages of the CL which means that they can *really* throw everything in the games, like making injections to injured players like they did this season.

IMO Man Utd is not extremely threatening. I've yet to see Lukaku play a great game against good opposition, and IMO all their wingers and fullbacks are barely average except for Martial. Their midfield and central defense are good because of their physicality but with European refs they won't get away with really hard tackles and one red card in a knock out round means it's probably over.

Here's the important part:

&gt;The statement also pointed out that Uefa Disciplinary Regulations strictly forbid a club to ""exert, or attempt to exert, any influence whatsoever over the players that another club may (or may not) field in a match"".

&gt;The governing body added that any private contract between clubs which might influence player selection is ""null, void and unenforceable"" and that sanctions would be made against any club violating these regulations.

We can say that we've got new young players and it's true, most if not all of them will be great players in just a few years, but we can't yet compare Ceballos to James, he isn't at that level yet. We also can't really consider Llorente and Vallejo in big games, not yet at least. This is where Pepe would have been great. Take the Valencia game from tomorrow, Ramos and Varane are out, why couldn't we have kept Pepe? We also lost Morata, and we haven't gotten any new signing up front. He scored more goals than Benzema last season, playing a lot less and being arguably the best player of our ""B-Team"" from last season. I think we had the best squad depth probably ever, and even with injury problems we tackled everything fine. We missed Bale for months, yet it had little to no impact on the team. 

Even if our new signings are great, and in the long run may prove to be amazing, right now, this season, I don't think we'll be as good as last one.

realmadrid,"Asensio is very talented. Like I said, he'll probably reach double-double in goals and assists in the future. Kinda like Hazard in Chelsea, Neymar in Barça(now PSG), Robben in Bayern etc. But notice the trend; are any of the players I mentioned ""main goalscorers""? No. You got Costa(now Morata) in Chelsea, Suarez in Barça, Cavani in PSG, Lewa in Bayern etc. 

These are star players that can work with main target mans and strikers. That's how they maintain their goalscorer-playmaker role. 

But the problem is, Ronaldo and Messi set a wrong example. These guys are not human. They don't play as main strikers or playmakers and still score more goals than their striker partners and assist more than playmakers in their team.

We watch these two and expect Asensio to score and assist like Ronaldo. That's very hard, even impossible. Ronaldo constantly evolved his game, I wrote about it elsewhere. He's not natural striker, but he plays like one. He's natural winger, but doesn't play like that anymore. Benzema is the striker, but in matches he switches role with Ronaldo. Similar with Messi. He's just a beast that scores goals and makes assists with ease.

With Asensio, we should develop a Hazard like playmaker/winger. That would be very ideal after Ronaldo leaves us. Then we should find a good, young, clinical striker outfront that can form a partnership with Asensio in two forward 4-4-2 formation or 4-3-3 with Asensio as LW, a RW and our main striker upfront.

This doesn't mean Asensio won't score 25-30 goals. If he is able to fill in Ronaldo's shoes and scores huge chunks of goals, nobody holds him back. But his main role should be Hazard type inside forward/playmaker type winger. That will ensure a constant good performance from Asensio without depending on him for scoring goals. But the main goalscorer should be someone else. 

Otherwise, Asensio as main striker would limit his potential and talent. Just like players like Hazard, Robben, Neymar etc. always prefer to play alongside a striker, rather than being the main guy upfront. That's my opinion.",1503699354,dm4o7db,t3_6vwsi2,t1_dm4jz6m

realmadrid,"I agree that they're stronger, but not because of Dembele and Coutinho. But rather Paulinho and Semedo.

Wait, hear me out. The issues Barcelona face right now are not going forward but keeping the front lines supplied. Notice how Messi is constantly dropping super deep to get the ball to bring it forward. This makes it much easier for opposing teams to guard Suarez up front because nobody else is a problem up there. This also means there's more room to guard Messi, it forces him to have to cover way more of the pitch to be a threat.

This is where Paulinho and Semedo come in. Barcelona knows they need to adapt to a new philosophy because the current one requires such a specific calibre of player and a very specific set of skills. These types of players are hard to find and the ones that are available often only fit into one of those 2 requirements rather than both. The ones that do fit into both are already here at Madrid, or at Bayern or PSG. So, the next best thing is to change how you play. Paulinho adds in that verticality to connect the midfield to the attack. He can bring the ball up and make deep runs. Is he the best player for this? Probably not. But he's probably pretty good at it. They need to address immediate needs first, and then focus on the future.",1503692778,dm4irxa,t3_6vxvoz,t1_dm47ydy

I don't doubt that we will eventually find a new striker that will make a great strikeforce with Asensio but I'm kind of disappointed because Mbappé coming to us was going to be great, an 18 year old fan of the club that comes to play with his idol Ronaldo and for Zidane and that can stay with us for 15 years and have a great rivalry with Dembelé.

Now he'll go to PSG with massive pressure on his shoulders because  a lot of people expect him to fail, and he will probably be a starter, but on the right wing where he never played for Monaco AFAIK, and where he'll become a laughing stock if he doesn't score 5 goals a month because a lot of people in France hate PSG.

Instead if he came here, the success would be instant because team and players were already sharing his philosophy. Oh well, I'm happy Zidane turns out to be perfect for us.

Yeah, in summary the direct and fast play style Klopp left at Dortmund is our kryptonite and both teams with shared football mentality neutralize each other. It ends up with very weird results and very unpredictable matches.

He never complains, keeps his head down and when given minutes he makes the most of it.

Players like Dembele and Mbappe are honestly in it for the money and not for improvement in their football for future success.

Dortmund and Monaco are great clubs for further development and would have given them a large salary as well.

If Mbappe wanted to play for Real he would have still received a lot of money and would be on the best team in the world but clearly he was greedy.

Okay the penalty was bullshit but Barcelona get penalties from dives with every ref in Spain or in the CL. I don't think we can assume that they paid off all of them, so I don't know, maybe Barça spend their training sessions perfecting their diving technique or something.

The other decision comes from the fact that apparently the federation decided to toughen their stance on dives and they know give out yellows like candy when they see it happen. In theory that would be great, but since the refs are too thick to realize that it can be not a foul AND not a dive they'll be giving a lot of yellows to attackers.

So sure those two decisions were wrong, but if I was a ref and someone paid me off I wouldn't give the team a pen, that's too obvious, I'd give fouls to every single touch on their players, and advantage them in every single small call. For example I think that one of the counter attacks we scored came from someone who tackled Messi, if the refs blows the whistle there there's no goal.

This is not professionalism. This is forcing a transfer move. This is the business.

Lastly, this is a market. If PSG value Mbappe at 300k a week then RM should pay that if they want and not complain if they're not willing to pay that.

However, he lacks that little bit of aggressiveness that makes Ramos who he is at his best--not just stopping chances and not committing mistakes, but proactively cutting them out from the start and winning the ball back.

realmadrid,"Right now? Nobody. But he's 19 and seems to have a great talent and great potential. I know our current problem lies in striker position but we need to invest in good, young wingers as well. So far we have Ronaldo/Asensio for LW and Bale/Lucas for RW. Vinicius Jr. seems like a guy that can play on both wings, but he'll join our team next year and probably spend some couple of years on loan(unless he proves himself immediately and enter first team at the age of 18). Especially Bale/Lucas side is concerning. 

We're good for now, but we'll need young wingers in the near future(LW seems secured after Asensio, my main concern is RW).",1503618963,dm35ngd,t3_6vs5x8,t1_dm310o5

Real Madrid had to adapt to that tactic and counter it. So now, we can play very good against teams that are willing to bring ball to our third and pass it there. We can break apart those teams from counters. But Dortmund team always prefer very direct and fast football. They come, they attack quickly and end their turn. That's something we don't get used to and it surprises us. Funny thing is both Dortmund and Real share similar football playing styles, so those two systems kinda clash with each other and results in scores like 2-2, 3-3 etc.

At least that's my opinion, it could be wrong lol.",1503618607,dm35dqz,t3_6vs6au,t1_dm30qt9

APOEL will be the punching bag of the group.

Dortmund are always on godmode against us but they have a pretty leaky defence. Last year we might have drawn both games but I thought we were never really in danger and they mostly scored goals that came from our errors (Navas punching the ball back to Aubameyang, leaving Reus alone in the box,...). Overall I think we are better now than we were (especially in the first leg when we were having our ""draw curse"" against yellow teams), while I don't think they have improved and Reus will probably miss both legs.

Pot 3: I don't want to face Liverpool, if only because I cheer for them in the Premier League and would like to see them make it to the knockout stage. 

Pot 4: RB Leipzig is the real wildcard of this group. Sporting CP also gave us a fight last year.



All in all, Real Madrid should end up with a more favorable group. We can't draw the real heavyweights of Pot 2 (Barça and Atletico), Bayern and Juve are in Pot 1 with us, and we have the talent and depth to overcome any starting XI these teams can throw at us.

realmadrid,"Not sure about that. Tejero is hardworking and likeable but he wasnt even one of the best defenders in midtable Castilla last year. Achraf and Quezada are better fullbacks than him imo. Also he has played at CB like you said but he is pretty meh in that position. In the US preseason game against City he was very average and at fault for many attacks.

Nacho at his current age was Castilla captain and doing far better. Who knows tho, Tejero can still improve, he's young.",1503566694,dm20k9r,t3_6vpm6m,t3_6vpm6m

realmadrid,"I see what you're saying bro, but I think Nacho's rating is pretty well established in our team. He's been here for many years and the team is more than happy with him. It doesn't need claims like ""he's the best DEFENDER"", which seem a bit baity.",1503560729,dm1yg4f,t3_6vodc2,t1_dm1y8dv
realmadrid,"No, but a lot of people wanted him to start ahead of Benzema and that was wrong in my opinion. Even though he had better stats. If you see what I wrote, you can see that I never said Nacho should replace Ramos/Varane, because of the same reason why Morata shouldn't replace Benz. For God's sake my username is a tribute to Ramos. I'm just trying to elevate Nacho's rating in our team, so that he won't be taken for granted. If anything I would probably have him replace Varane and join Ramos from how good his defensive ability is. However since he hasn't prove himself over a long stretch of games, I would NOT change him with our current solid, unstoppable, immovable, sexy partnership that is Varamos. ",1503560132,dm1y8dv,t3_6vodc2,t1_dm1y1ok
realmadrid,So Morata was our best attacker last season because he scored more goals per minute than any other player?,1503559630,dm1y1ok,t3_6vodc2,t1_dm1xwsp
realmadrid,That's exactly why I said I would not drop Ramos! I just think nacho is our most consistent CB and that makes him the best defender. It's like saying Morata was better at attack than Benzema because of his stats and whatnot but I wouldn't drop Benz because of his link up play with Ronaldo. ,1503559274,dm1xwsp,t3_6vodc2,t1_dm1xc99
realmadrid,"Of course it does. He plays as a defender, and at his position he's one of the best at defending (when he's focused, yeah) and probably the best ever at scoring. He's also the leader of the whole team, without discussion. He's a special player that will go down in history as Real Madrid's best defender, and you're trying to convince us that he's not even our best CB because for some reason positions only have specific roles, and if you happen to do something out of the ordinary it doesn't really matter because it's not your role and they should sign someone in a different position to do it. It doesn't work like that, bro. ",1503557789,dm1xc99,t3_6vodc2,t1_dm1x44o
realmadrid,That's exactly why I said I wouldn't bench Ramos or Varane. Because Ramos brings us the game winning goals. But that doesn't make you the best defender,1503557235,dm1x44o,t3_6vodc2,t1_dm1x0ps
realmadrid,"&gt; True but that's not the role of a defender. Who signs a defender to win them the CL.

That's ridiculous. May as well bench Marcelo, since what he does best ""is not his role"".",1503557007,dm1x0ps,t3_6vodc2,t1_dm1wxmx
realmadrid,"True but that's not the role of a defender. Who signs a defender to win them the CL. You sign a neymar or a Ronaldo. However that's why I'd keep Ramos and Varane as our partnership at the back. They're too important to drop. Ramos has his leadership, aggressive defending and game winning goals and Varane on his day can put any player in the world in his pocket. But for consistency and defending ability, I honestly think Nacho is the best. ",1503556796,dm1wxmx,t3_6vodc2,t1_dm1wv1v

However I have yet to see Nacho put in a foot wrong. He's so damn reliable. When I try to think of Ramos/Varane mess ups, I can actually remember them, but Nacho (although hasn't played as much) hasn't done any major mistakes. 

Atletico away 3-0 La Liga (Nacho and Varane)

Bayern both legs (Nacho and Ramos)

Atletico 3-0 UCL (came on for carvajal at RB) 

I know that's a small sample size but lets ignore stats and see his actual performances. Against depor last game, he was so damn good. Maybe with more games his weaknesses can be seen but I have yet to see him do any significant errors. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Like you said he can walk in to any big team atm and I wouldn't sell him for anything less than 50mil. We are so lucky to have 4 amazing cbs (Vallejo I didn't forget you!).

But you're right, let's say even if Mayoral surpasses Ronaldo in appearances(possible if he plays regularly until the end) and goals(very hard achievement), there's still the thing about average goal per game ratio. The standard Ronaldo set is absolutely crazy and we need a very special talent(one in a generation type) to break Ronaldo's record.

Even then you'll ask, how more can you improve Ronaldo's ratio? The man already plays with something around 1 goal per game and that's ridiculous. What can Mayoral, Mbappe or whoever can do, 2 goals per game?

But he'll probably cut inside from both flanks and link up with both Lucas and Asensio, while Mayoral waiting in the box for opportunities. At other stages he will play central and expect crosses from Lucas-Hakimi and Theo-Asensio. I especially await Theo-Asensio duo, they are going to be lit 🔥🔥

Anyways. I'd go with Casilla; Theo, Ramos, Nacho, Achraf; Llorente, Ceballos, Kroos, Isco; Ronaldo, Borja. Rotational, but with Ramos, Kroos, and Isco in for some stability. Ronaldo in of course so he doesn't get rusty over his brief withdrawal.

realmadrid,Lol,1503435666,dlzi67l,t3_6vbcuq,t1_dlz7j0r
realmadrid,...you're glad he pushed a referee? That will get him banned every time. ,1503435250,dlzhsiv,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzho8o
realmadrid,I never said it was okay. I said I was glad that he did it. I don't know how many times I have to correct you.,1503435121,dlzho8o,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzh8ao
realmadrid,hahaha I guess it depends on who raped her.,1503435091,dlzhn83,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzfw9z
realmadrid,And you think it's ok to just push a referee?,1503434651,dlzh8ao,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzcl6k
realmadrid,"Yup, the crazy thing is that people actually agree with him. ",1503434538,dlzh4az,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzfw9z
realmadrid,"It was a blatant shit call, it wasnt smart of cristiano but in el clasico in the super cup of spain a very important match it was one of the worst second yellows ive ever seen called, especially after the rival team had just been given a penalty of a large dive earlier. Refs just dont and should not do what that ref did so cristiano shouldnt have pushed him but the ridiculous severity of the situation you must give him slack..",1503434485,dlzh2io,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlz94d2
realmadrid,LOL I see you lurking. NikonWhite is currently on top and it's staying there buddy.,1503433475,dlzg4cj,t3_6vbcuq,t1_dlz8wax

realmadrid,Lol Modric,1503432878,dlzfk46,t3_6vcoal,t3_6vcoal
realmadrid,"Hahah woah there buddy. So, all my support for the last 22 years should go out the window because I am glad that Ronaldo pushed a ref? I was even glad when Pepe massacred those three Getafe players in the 2009 season too. And that was 10 matches. Sometimes your emotion takes over and you make a mistake. But please teach me how to be a Real Madrid fan, since you're so good at it.",1503430917,dlzdpte,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzdae2
realmadrid,"How can you call yourself a Real Madrid fan and be glad that inarguably one of your most important players gets banned? Yes, this ban can have some benefits, but the fact that you're glad he shoved the ref is just outrageous. ",1503430455,dlzdae2,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzd4fd
realmadrid,Who really cares? I'm glad that he did that. Are we going to suffer these couple games without Cristiano? There's literally no consequence. Him missing 5 games is not a bad thing for me. Two of them are already gone. Clean sheets in both.  ,1503430278,dlzd4fd,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzcp1h

realmadrid,Are you retarded? Everyone knows why he pushed the ref. There's no need to assume.,1503429971,dlzctsc,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzbydd
realmadrid,A push that resulted in a five-match ban. I don't think it's appropriate to call it just a push. Might as well add the fact that is was a push on the ref.,1503429829,dlzcp1h,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzcl6k
realmadrid,haha it's just a push,1503429713,dlzcl6k,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzcaan
realmadrid,"It's justified by the poor call, but Ronaldo needs to know better. He brought it upon himself, and regardless of how many times they appeal the ban, it will never rescinded.",1503429568,dlzcgc1,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzcaan
realmadrid,"I agree that it was a bullshit call, but Ronaldo was 100% in the wrong for shoving him and I don't see how it can be justified. ",1503429390,dlzcaan,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzc76r
realmadrid,It's never okay to shove a ref. But I feel like Ronaldo's was justified to some extent.,1503429296,dlzc76r,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzc1rt
realmadrid,"I know why he pushed him. 

The issue is when people think it's ok to shove a ref. ",1503429134,dlzc1rt,t3_6vcmu9,t1_dlzbydd
realmadrid,"Why draw stupid comparisons? There's no need to assume why Ronaldo pushed the ref. The ref made a terrible call, that's why Ronaldo pushed him.
